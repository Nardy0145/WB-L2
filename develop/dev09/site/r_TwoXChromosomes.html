I‚Äôm a bra fitter at a specialty large cup store. We stock up to a 44 inch band and up to a UK K-KK cup. I‚Äôve been there long enough to see people get super emotional about bra shopping and I don‚Äôt want to gatekeep so I‚Äôm here to offer some (unasked for) advice:</p>

<p>1: the band size.</p>

<p>When you put your band on, put it on the LOOSEST hook. You want it to be sitting at the top of your rib cage. Stick a finger under your boob, and push up a little so your finger is supporting the weight of your breast. That‚Äôs where the wire/band should sit. You want it running in a fairly straight line around your body, or as close to straight as you can comfortably get. If the band is running up to between your shoulder blades - it doesn‚Äôt fit. </p>

<p>This will feel slightly firmer than what you‚Äôre used too, but bras stretch. Move to the middle hook when it stretches out too much, then the last. Once it‚Äôs all stretched out, it‚Äôs not gonna support you. That‚Äôs a home bra now.  They‚Äôve done their time and get to retire. </p>

<p>2: the straps.</p>

<p>You want the straps to be tight but not too tight. This means in general, you should fit no more than 2/3 fingers under each strap with a little give.</p>

<p>3:  the wire.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky. </p>

<p>First off: almost everyone has one boob that is bigger. Just how it goes. That‚Äôs the one we fit too. When you put the bra on, the wire should be somewhere near or under your armpit. That‚Äôs where the breast tissue starts. </p>

<p>WHAT YOURE GONNA DO: 
Take the end of the wire, the part under your arm in one hand, and with your other hand (if you can) grab your breast tissue. Pull your breast tissue to the FRONT, wire to the BACK. 
Do this on both sides. </p>

<p>How does it feel? Is the wire digging in to your breast tissue at all? No? Good. </p>

<p>Look at your bra front on - the cup fabric should not be digging into your breast at all. No ‚Äòdouble boobing‚Äô. No squished boobs. </p>

<p>If the wire is BEHIND your armpit it‚Äôs too big in the cup.</p>

<p>Your breasts won‚Äôt be squished to the side, they‚Äôll be up and more centred and most importantly SUPPORTED!!! We love this!!!</p>

<p>4: Bra styles</p>

<p>Not every boob fills out every bra perfectly even with the right cup and band size. I‚Äôm not particularly ‚Äòfull‚Äô up top so when I wear most tshirt bras, I have some gaps in there. We‚Äôre used to wearing too-small cups and filling out every part. It‚Äôs sucky but it‚Äôs true.  If that‚Äôs something that bothers you, look for bras you feel great in and who gives a fuck about a bit of air in there. That‚Äôs a pocket now. EDIT: this specifically concerns stiff moulded cup bras. Soft cup bras - the fabric should stretch evenly over your breast with minimal gapping. Some gapping at the apex (the top under the strap) is to be expected in less full breasts. If the fabric is rippling across most of your breast arrange your breast and see how it is. It could be a style issue, the cups could be deeper than needed. </p>

<p>Also put your top on over the bra to see if you like the shape. V. Important. </p>

<p>Also!!! Move around in the bra a bit to see if you like the feel. </p>

<p>5:  Your comfort and ability comes first!</p>

<p>If you have problems doing up a bra with a smaller band (Limited mobility) it‚Äôs OK to size up until you can put it on. I won‚Äôt be mad, promise. Not everyone can do a firmer band up. As long as the cup fits correctly, it‚Äôll be mostly fine. Just be aware your bra will stretch out quicker and offer less support over time. It sucks but what can ya do. If you need a front closing bra, the same issue will occur. It really is annoying I‚Äôm sorry. </p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: </p>

<p>6: I forgot a rule! The seperator!</p>

<p>This will differ depending on how your breasts sit and the shape of them but usually, you want the seperator (the little thing between the cups) to be against your chest, not poking out. Usually if it‚Äôs not on your chest it means there‚Äôs a fit issue, but depending on the style of your bra and the shape of your boobs, it might not sit flat. That‚Äôs down to the fullness of your breasts and how close together they are, and it‚Äôs up to you if you buy it then! </p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD AGAIN: wow my brain is not good today. </p>

<p>7: sister sizing!</p>

<p>Not recommended because of the band support stuff but I know not everyone has access to a lot of diverse bra sizes. If you are a 30 inch but people only have 32inch, you CAN wear the 32inch but if you go UP in the band, you go DOWN in the cup size. Cup size is relative to band size it‚Äôs not constant! :)</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<p>Band should be in a mostly straight line from UNDER your breasts/top of your rib cage and around your back.</p>

<p>Wire should be BEHIND your breast tissue. Arrange it to see if that‚Äôs so. Fit to your larger breast.</p>

<p>The cup fabric should NOT dig in to your breast tissue, no double boobing. Your breasts should not be squished. </p>

<p>Bras are like shoes - we break them in a little. </p>

<p>No manufacturer has consistent sizing across all styles. Try crap on. </p>

<p>Ideally hand wash your bras in lukewarm water and dry flat in the shade to make them last (I wash mine in the shower). Otherwise wrap your bra in some tshirts and use a lingerie bag on a gentle setting. This will stop the wire getting stuck in the machine and bending.</p>

<p>And remember! Your comfort is your business in the end - if you ignore this, that‚Äôs ok! If you don‚Äôt wear wired bras, that‚Äôs also fine! If you break into my workplace and burn it down!‚Ä¶..please don‚Äôt I really like it there. 
If you have any further questions feel free to message but please don‚Äôt send me pics of you in bras. Like c‚Äômon I‚Äôm a stranger. </p>

<p>Have fun and happy fitting! </p>

<p>DISCLAIMER:
These are the rules I was trained on when I started but again it‚Äôs by feel and sight and also comfort.</p>

<p>ETA: I am a UK8G-GG who was fitted as a 12E for years by retailers doing the +4 method. Band too big, wire dug into breast. Don‚Äôt be me, be better. my boss and her business has changed how I carry myself and how I feel about my breasts.</p>

<p>Basically I arrived home one night to my two male roommates who were pregaming and having fun, which I&#39;m cool with, and they invited me out to a bar, which I said sure! I needed a drink and they&#39;re fairly good company. My female roommate was coming home later and would join later. </p>

<p>Then pops out a man I&#39;ve never met before who said he&#39;s my roommate&#39;s brother, and I&#39;m cool with it I enjoy hanging with new people. </p>

<p>But as we Uber over he reveals many sexist remarks like how he believes women shouldn&#39;t drive if their husband or boyfriend is in the car, how he wants to pick up chicks on the way there and how his bitch wife is a bitch and how he hates her. At this point I&#39;m going into a &quot;avoid it and ignore it mode&quot;, especially as my male roommates on either side of me are bellowing out in laughter at his remarks, and so am I, out of nervousness.</p>

<p>When we get to the bar he starts making really weird comments towards me, like how my boyfriend let&#39;s me hang out with guys and how if he isn&#39;t here tonight he&#39;s going to hit on me. And then he says he wants to do me in my room. My roommates let out nervous laughter but ultimately say nothing, later remarking what a character he is and how they like his honesty.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m dissociating, drinking more and laughing louder and louder to blend in as much as possible because I&#39;m just nervous and don&#39;t know what to do. Thankfully I don&#39;t get very drunk and my other roommate comes and picks us up.</p>

<p>He proceeded to stay the night, thankfully leaving me alone EXCEPT FOR ONE TIME he CAME UP TO THE CURTAIN OF MY BEDROOM and asked if i wanted to play beer pong which I refused and thankfully he went away.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been here a few days thankfully without anything else going on.</p>

<p>Currently I don&#39;t know what to do. If i say anything i fear retribution, in the past my female roommate has expressed worry at me having my bf over because she feels unsafe, but then she got to know him a bit and everything turned out alright. I wonder if she feels comfortable bringing her brother here because of this? Then if i say i don&#39;t feel comfortable with him being here she might say well she isn&#39;t comfortable with my bf coming over but she manages, which I guess might be right, but he hasn&#39;t done anything or said anything like her brother did to me, I&#39;m just really scared over my roommates completely rejecting the idea of my bf coming over anymore because he&#39;s a big part of my life, and idk what to do.</p>

<p>I just hope he leaves soon.</p>

I slammed on my brakes in time thankfully didn&#39;t hit the guy. He then rolls down his window and starts yelling and waving me the finger. I have no idea what I did? I was going with the flow of traffic, didn&#39;t change lanes, beep my horn, swerve, nothing. Anyway, the whole rest of the 20 minute drive to work he continued to drive way under the speed limit, stay stopped several seconds at a light after it turned green, all while screaming out his window and waving his finger around at me. I didn&#39;t react but twice pulled into the next lane over to get behind someone else, but he always managed to squeeze himself back in front of me so he could harass me more. I should have called the police but my heart was just pounding the whole time and I was focused on an exit strategy. I guess he got what he wanted, terrorising a woman on her way to work for... what? Whoever says men aren&#39;t emotional clearly forgot about anger being an emotion. Whatever infraction this guy perceived I &quot;did to him&quot; was so minor or completely non-existent that racking my brains I can&#39;t think of what said infraction could have been, but he was so emotional about it he had a complete meltdown for over 20 minutes about it. The last time I had a 20 minute meltdown over nothing, I was a toddler. Men need to grow up and control their emotions.</p>

<p>im part of the biggest weight loss forum on the internet. its also on reddit. i just wanted to warn people that unfortunately this group wont allow discussion of womens issues.</p>

<p>lots of people in the weight loss community use period tracking apps because period can effect weight. weve now been told that discussing period tracking apps is politics and the thread has been locked. the forum has over 3.5 million people. the person who posted the original post did not know that they were now tracking period apps and others were warning them and others in the thread. i was banned because i said that our current administration does not recommend period tracking apps at this time and &quot;women&#39;s rights isnt politics&quot;. discussion of period tracking apps was allowed before this.</p>

<p>it feels like theyre trying to push that under the rug by banning all discussion and locking threads. do they want women to not know about period tracking apps? do they want women to not know that this can be used against them? cause thats what it seems like.</p>

<p>reddit hates women and its making me sick. this sub is literally one of the only forums where womens issues can be discussed. and thats looked on as normal.</p>

<p>&quot;lets just brush this alllll the way under the rug, its just politics boys!!&quot;</p>

I don‚Äôt like the 90s styles that are in right now. Funny because if you would have told me ten years ago I would be able to buy this stuff again, I would have felt so nostalgic about it. But seeing it now I‚Äôm just not into it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think it‚Äôs super cute on other people, but it is just not flattering on me at all, especially the jeans. Not to mention I‚Äôm 40 and would look like I‚Äôm trying too hard in most of these  styles. Lol I purchased a couple of cute dresses for work on Amazon this summer, but I‚Äôm not even finding stuff on there anymore. I still want to look trendy and put together, but I just don‚Äôt even know where to start.</p>

He&#39;s backing himself up by saying he was getting it out the night before. That also made me slightly uncomfortable but I didn&#39;t say anything because he was just doing it to people we know. We go to some pretty off the wall 18+ festivals where this behaviour is kind of to be expected and i wouldn&#39;t have so much of an issue with but this festival is open to under 18s (even under 16s which is the age of consent in my country) so I just think it&#39;s massively out of order.
He&#39;s refusing to admit what he did was f*cked up and everyone else is basically saying that I&#39;m overreacting because I&#39;m sleep deprived and fed up after being on the road in fields for 4 months working.
But this has genuinely tore me apart and I just want to know if my feelings are valid or I am actually overreacting?</p>

I am overwhelmed and just need an outsiders opinion. I also do apologise because this might be triggering. </p>

<p>I was sexually violated by my step-father when i was 16/17 and subsequently had to move out their house. So I‚Äôve been doing this life thing on my own for a bit. Along the way i met some very amazing people who have been so unconditionally loving, kind, generous and understanding. I met my lovely fianc√© 6 years ago and he has been my absolute rock. I also have some very amazing friends I‚Äôve made for life (IDK if that made sense). I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be around if i did not have the right people who took me in when i first moved out. And i am eternally grateful for these people, you have no idea how many times i wanted to end it all but i cannot bear to hurt my loved ones. However, my struggles with my mental wellbeing has taken quite a toll on me through the years and i was diagnosed with a personality disorder which made it infinitely worse to be functioning. I did receive youth therapy when the assault happened and have been in and out of the healthcare system for years. </p>

<p>Recently I‚Äôve been a big slump and on the advice of multiple medical professionals i reached out to a government organisation to access funded therapy for my assault. I am still in the early stages of assessment for the funded therapy which means i have to open up the pandora‚Äôs box. My assessor has had to report their findings and they read me some of the things and i just had the biggest cry in a very long time. The assessor read out the law‚Äôs my abuser had broken (indecent assault of a minor), and having a professional put it into technical terms just overwhelmed me so much. They‚Äôre urging me to report my abuser, as this falls under a serious crimes act my assessor doesn‚Äôt even need my consent to report him to the police. But I‚Äôve been given the choice to report him. And i always regretted not reporting him because he‚Äôs still living an amazing life meanwhile i am a shrivelled husk of a woman most days. </p>

<p>I know in my bones that if i do not report him i will regret it later in life. And god forbid he does it to someone else, i wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself. I cried to my partner, to my sister about how me reporting my abuser is going to hurt our mother.  She‚Äôs never believed me, even blamed me for what‚Äôs happened. She‚Äôs told her side of the family that i am probably lying, no matter how much she‚Äôs lied or denied it i still love her. I understand that its difficult for her to accept this, but she should‚Äôve protected me. She should‚Äôve believed me. I am so angry, so hurt, he broke me! Why does he get to live his best life while i struggle to function? Why do i feel guilty for wanting justice? Why do i care so much about how this will affect them? When they‚Äôve not given a fuck for my wellbeing.. </p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know what to do, i know i am going to report him soon.. i just feel so horrible.. i am sorry for the rant :‚Äô)</p>

<p>I just wanted to tell you that I saw everything. I heard everything. I heard him screaming at you over the deafening music, calling you a bitch, a c***, telling you to go fuck yourself. I saw the way he completely changed his behavior when he spoke to the man in front of him. I saw the way he was standing over you, feeding you a steady stream of abuse in your ear while you wiped the tears from your cheeks. I don‚Äôt know how you had the strength to keep standing, as he called you names in your ear for three straight songs. </p>

<p>I needed you to know I saw and I heard and I didn‚Äôt think it was okay. It was terrifying. I was terrified for you. I was terrified of intervening and making it worse. Terrified that if I didn‚Äôt, you would think he could speak to you that way in front of other people without consequence. I hope the security officer we sent to you didn‚Äôt make things worse when you went home with him, before the headliner even came on. </p>

<p>You probably won‚Äôt read this. But I hope someone like you will. You didn‚Äôt deserve to be spoken to like that. Im guessing he talks to you like that a lot. It was abuse and it was scary. I‚Äôm still wrestling with my silence, and whether it helped you or hurt you. But make no mistake, my silence was to protect you, not him. I saw. I heard. And it wasn‚Äôt okay.</p>

<p>I hope you are ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

Thanks in advance for anyone who reads this.</p>

<p>TW: SA, misogyny</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know how to deal with this. Sometimes, I am totally fine and feel like I can manage. Others I am a total mess and I really don&#39;t know where to place my rage.</p>

<p>I work in a male dominated field that is well known for its boys club behavior and general misogyny. That said, I believed it was getting better. My company has a work placement initiative for women for gods sake!</p>

<p>But unfortunately, I went out one night for dinner with a group of managers on my team (being a manager myself, and naively thinking I was somehow immune from this bullshit). One of them invited their boss, who I&#39;ve always liked. He began ordering us shots, and before I know it he is caressing my arm and telling me that no woman is truly respected in high level business meetings and if I wanted to get ahead I would need a man like him to represent me. He wouldn&#39;t let go even when I tried to pull away, kept telling me to relax.</p>

<p>I got away safely. I spoke to HR. They were great, investigated and it seemed like he would be let go. Then he resigned instead.</p>

<p>My workplace is putting several initiatives in place to help prevent things in the future.</p>

<p>And I cannot stop being angry, and distrustful, and broken. I spent years trying to get over my PTSD and fear of men, and now I&#39;m back to fearing every single one of them. I struggle even to be mad at him, because I know him and I&#39;ve humanised him and other people keep suggesting he just made a really shitty mistake.</p>

<p>But I know other executives at my work are like this. I know other companies in my industry are worse. How do I move forward when there&#39;s nowhere to go? I can tell my CEO no longer likes me after this, which makes me want to burn my entire company to the ground.</p>

<p>I&#39;m scared for the women at my company, the women in my industry that will pretend that everything is fine because they&#39;re too scared to speak up.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sick of being treated like a prize, like something to be protected or white knighted. I&#39;m sick of being treated like I need a &#39;mentor&#39;, like I&#39;m lesser than, weaker or less experienced than the next guy. I&#39;m sick of being treated like a woman, and I hate that I can&#39;t be proud of who I am.</p>
