I promised 14 different taco stalls, Lucha libre wrestling, lots of different drinks and a whole load of fun.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where I fucked up. I proudly bring my friends to Covent Garden Market in London UK on Sunday and begin searching for this taco festival. We can&#39;t find it. There is a distinct lack of tacos and none of the staff seem to know what we&#39;re talking about.   </p>

<p>Checking the instagram for the event, it turns out that the taco festival was in Covent Garden Market, London, ONTARIO CANADA. I&#39;m never going to live this down and have been roasted all weekend.  </p>

<p>TLDR: I hyped a taco festival event up for a month and brought friends to Covent Garden Market in London UK. We spent ages searching for tacos, the festival was in Covent Garden Market, London, Ontario. Roasted for days by my friends</p>

I accepted the babysitting job without hesitation. It was easy money and my cousins are intimidatingly cool for their age. However, as soon as I was alone with my cousins, it became very clear very quickly they had one thing on their minds. Sex. </p>

<p>The two of them looked at me like I was an older version of them and assumed I could answer their inappropriate sex questions based on my personal experience. I was bombarded with questions like do I have enough sex, do I eat pussy, do I have anal sex, do I use condoms, do I know how to make &quot;sperm&quot; taste better for the person sucking the dick, etc. And those were only from the one 12 year old btw. </p>

<p>I provided as many answers as possible as delicately as possible. Most of my knowledge came from the internet, less than 5% was personal experience, but as far as my cousins were concerned, I fucked. Thus, my fuck up. Last night my mom informed me that my aunt / her sister called from the hospital. Both twins had an allergic reaction to eating a whole pineapple that they bought after school with their bus money. </p>

<p>One of the twins cracked under pressure when my aunt confronted them and said I taught them that &quot;pineapple made sperm tastes good&quot;. My mom said my aunt was extremely disturbed at the thought of me telling her 12 year old children what would make them taste good. According to my mom, my aunt has made it quite clear that she no longer wants me near her kids and my mom said she completely agreed. Fml. </p>

<p><strong><em>Tl:dr My aunt asked me to babysit her 12 year old boys aka my twin cousins. The twins regarded me like an older brother and asked a bunch of sex questions, which I answered. Based on the answers I provided, the twins ended up in hospital due to an allergic reaction to eating an entire fucking pineapple, which they thought would add flavor to their cum. Now I&#39;m banned from babysitting.</em></strong></p>

<p>I wasn’t going to make this into a throwaway account, but my husband and best friend convinced me, so here we are. </p>

<p>This particular FU happened back in Feb 2020, I was trying to think up something fun and romantic for Valentine’s Day. My husband and I have a great sex life, even with young kids, but I’ve never had great game in the BJ department. I’m happy enough to go down there, but I’ve never let him finish in my mouth. Once a friend described swallowing as akin to “swallowing snot” and I’ve never gotten that image out of my head. So I decided, this was the year. I was going to man up and swallow the gravy. After a few painful (incognito) Google searches on “how to swallow semen” that yielded disappointing results, I finally figured it out. I had the perfect solution, I was going to give him road head! That way, I HAD to swallow, because I had no other option. I told him about my plan, and we agreed that this was definitely the best way. </p>

<p>The big night came, my mom got to our house to watch the kids. I had three twisted teas and a handful of my kid’s leftover goldfish to settle my nerves. I had outfitted our van into an oral shaggin’ wagon, complete with flavoured lube and a towel. I was ready. He was going to get the best blow j of his life. We head down a dark country road and I get started. I bust out every trick that I had read about in Cosmo in my 20’s. I feel like an empowered sex goddess, that is, until he grabbed my hair and moaned that he was about to come. At that moment, I panicked and tried to pull back, but it was too late. As he came, I promptly threw everything up into his lap, then burst into tears. </p>

<p>Bless his sweet heart, he didn’t even <em>realize</em> at first. He kept saying ‘don’t apologize baby, that was amazing. It feels so warm..so amazing.” Then, with some creeping concern, “Wait. Why is it chunky? Why do I feel chunks? Did… did you THROW UP on me??” </p>

<p>At this point we both start laughing uncontrollably on the side of the road while he mopped up his crotch with a towel. We then realized that he couldn’t very well go to dinner without pants, so we drove back to the house. I then had to sneak into my own home, past my mother and children, to get my husband puke-free pants for our date. </p>

<p>We decided that we weren’t hungry anymore and spent the rest of our date night blinking at each other over our starbucks wondering what the hell just happened. </p>

<p>Tl;dr : I tried to give my husband road head and I barfed on him instead.</p>

<p>This is a two-part fuck up, one that happened last week and the second part today. </p>

<p>So, as the title says, I fucked up by picking my girlfriend (we’ll call her Maria) over my job. Maria and I have been working together for a couple years now but she was in a relationship the whole time up until a few months ago. She was dating a guy (we’ll call him Hank) who is one of the longest tenured employees at our job, is extremely well liked and is a really good dude, though I wouldn’t say he and I were super close by any means. Maria and I run in similar social circles so we are around each other a LOT both inside and outside of work, and one thing led to another and we started dating. We immediately told Hank since we all work together, and he didn’t seem to care, but we made it a point to keep it quiet around the office to not start anything. </p>

<p>That is, until last week, when Maria and I were spotted out together and news made it back to the office. Our boss found out, and he was LIVID. He called me into his office and made a huge deal about me dating “a made-man’s” girl and how I’m a scumbag and a backstabber and all this. I tried to explain myself (admittedly didn’t do a good job because I’m an idiot) and he wasn’t having it. He tried to get me to admit what I was doing was wrong and that I made a mistake but I wouldn’t do it, and doubled down on my commitment to my girl. This fucked me, because the boss started telling me my contract was up for renewal in February and that I wouldn’t be renewed now. He said other things to cover his ass, like I’m not producing any value for the company anyways, and that technically I’m not getting fired I’ll just expire my current contract and wouldn’t get picked up again. So, essentially, picking my girlfriend has cost me my job. </p>

<p>That sucked, until today, when Maria decided she didn’t want to be with me anymore. She told me dating me was a mistake, that I was a rebound for her after she got out of a long relationship, that she would rather live a single life as she travels the country for her role at our company. She also threw some personal shots at me disguised as “advice to find a better girl” like: shave my head (I have long hair but am balding on top) and quit wearing a hat all the time, hit the gym (I’m a frail guy), and find something I’m good at  for work(think this was an echoing of my convo with my boss, who said I have no real talent). </p>

<p>So, I REALLY fucked up. </p>

<p>TL;DR: I fucked up by picking my girlfriend over my job, got canned, and then dumped.</p>

We had a meeting with the owners of the building and they’re so awesome. Later, I text my husband a list of questions to ask when he goes to see the apartment again tomorrow. Most of them were real, but I added something funny that I know he would laugh at. But I guess he didn’t read them and just copied and pasted them to the fucking email thread with the broker and landlord. They were all normal questions like “is there a brokers fee”, and “is there a doorbell that we can use to buzz people in”, and the one he failed to read but sent anyway - “are we still allowed to host our monthly swingers party”. Lol I hope we still get the apartment</p>

<p>TLDR: We are looking at a new apartment.

I (17m) informed him that my mom and dad were out for the evening. I could tell my uncle had been drinking and seemed kind of confused about what to say or do next, so I invited him in and said I was gonna call my parents to find out how far they are. My uncle advised me to leave my parents in peace and asked if I wanted to keep him company instead. I sat down. </p>

<p>Right off the bat my uncle did the &quot;I remember when I was your age&quot; routine, albeit the drunk version. He mentioned that he used to date my mom before my dad &quot;stole&quot; her from him. I kind of knew the story, but what I found out for the first time was that my uncle had my mom&#39;s name tattooed on his scalp. He showed me by spreading his hair. Afterwards, he said my mom has his name tattooed in the same spot on her scalp. My uncle and I spoke about random shit for another hour or so before he decided to leave. </p>

<p>When my parents eventually came home I did not waste any fucking time telling my mom that I knew she had a tattoo thanks to my drunk uncle. I wanted to see her reaction and hear her response, especially after she&#39;s made it very clear over the years that she would never approve of me getting a tattoo because it&#39;s a sin according to her. Little did I know that my dad, who shared my mom&#39;s opinion about tattoos, had no idea that my mom had a tattoo, let alone a tattoo of his brother&#39;s name. </p>

<p>My mom&#39;s first reaction was to look at my dad&#39;s reaction, which is when I realized I might have fucked up. My dad asked my mom if the tattoo was inside her bottom or something. My mom said no, it was on her head. My dad shook his head and asked my mom how big the tattoo was. My mom didn&#39;t really answer that question directly, she just said &quot;you know your brother&#39;s name has a lot of fucking letters.&quot; There was obvious tension between the two of them, which I took as my cue to exit that conversation and return to my room. </p>

<p>I could hear my mom and dad argue throughout the night. My dad was accusing my mom of being irresponsible when she was with his brother all those years ago and now she&#39;s making both of them look like hypocrites in front of me. My mom returned fire and said my dad needs to stop pretending to be the good guy when they both knew he was just as bad as his brother was back then, if not worse. I didn&#39;t want to hear any more, so I put on my headphones and listened to music until I fell asleep. </p>

<p>The tension between my mom and dad continued this morning. No one said a word. I&#39;m at school at the moment, wishing I never opened my mouth about the tattoo. </p>

<p>Tl:dr My uncle drunkenly told me that my mom tattooed his name on her scalp when they were young. I confronted my mom about the tattoo in front of my dad and realized my dad knew nothing about the tattoo and now my parents are fighting.</p>

When I was sitting in the airport in Boston, I noticed a bad smell, and it seemed like it might have been coming from my backpack.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I was at my gate at this point, which means I’d gone through customs/security already, complete with my bags going through the X-Ray machine.</p>

<p>I texted my partner about it and he said there have been some mice in his and his roommates place, so I should check  my bag for mouse poop. I didn’t have much time before boarding, so I said I’d check when I landed in Toronto. I was already nervous that I might have poop in my bag, with all my clothes and medications.</p>

<p>In Toronto I couldn’t see a bathroom so I went through security there, too, and got to my next gate before going into a bathroom and inspecting my bag.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there wasn’t any mouse poop in it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what was inside was A WHOLE DEAD MOUSE.</p>

<p>I accidentally smuggled a dead animal across the US-Canada border by air. I went through multiple security checkpoints, INCLUDING X-RAY, and no one noticed.</p>

<p>And to the janitor that opens up the used sanitary items box in the bathroom stall and finds a dead mouse wrapped in toilet paper, I am so so sorry. I had no options.</p>

<p>TLDR: A mouse died in my backpack and I unknowingly brought it across international borders  and no one stopped me.</p>

Also disclaimer, this story might gross some of you out.</p>

<p>So, I took the day off from work today and was enjoying some &quot;alone time&quot; while my gf was at work. I recently got into butt stuff for the extra stimulation, so I borrowed my gfs sex toy to use.</p>

<p>Once I was done, I noticed that the toy was dirty so I wanted to clean it well. Note this was only my second time experimenting with the toy, and last time it wasn&#39;t &quot;dirty&quot; after use. I took the toy to the sink and gave it a good wash with hot soapy water like usual.</p>

<p>Here is the gross part, the toy still smelled pretty bad after washing, and I could not get it to go away. So, I I turned to my good pal reddit for answers on how to get the stench gone. I tried a couple easy methods with no luck, so I went for the bake out option that someone recommended here:
 <a href="https://teddit.net/r/SexToys/comments/p93k2n/how_do_i_get_the_shit_smell_off_my_dildo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SexToys/comments/p93k2n/how_do_i_get_the_shit_smell_off_my_dildo/</a></p>

<p>Being the dildo novice that I am, I assumed the thing was made out of silicone, which is high-temp resistant. The post above recommend one hour at 400F to remove the smell, so I set my oven and threw the thing in there on a sheet pan.</p>

<p>We recently bought one of those plastic divider curtains for our hallway to keep the cool air on the living room side of the house, so I didn&#39;t notice the burning smell until i walked out into the kitchen. I immediately noticed smoke in the air and started coughing. At first I thought it was the parchment paper burning, but the smoke was a different kind of irritating.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, I knew I fucked up. I opened the oven and a billow of smoke rushed out and the toy was now a smoking purple puddle. I turned off the oven and ran out of the kitchen to grab something to cover my face. Went back in and grabbed the sheet pan and chucked it into the driveway while holding my breath.</p>

<p>I grabbed a fan and propped the door open to ventilate. Then I went to the Adam and Eve website to try and find the toy to figure out what material it was made out of. Well turns out it&#39;s PVC, which I learned today releases extremely harmful chemical fumes when heated past 145F....it was at 400F for like 20 mins. Here is some info on the fumes it releases.</p>

<p>After reading all this im freaking out that i inhaled poison...and some of rhe smell and smoke started to migrate into the living room where we have our ferret. I opened some windows, threw the ferty in her carrier, and sat in my car with the AC on for awhile.</p>

<p>All is good now and the smell is gone, could have been alot worse. </p>

<p>PSA: Don&#39;t assume your dildo is silicone and heat resistant and put it in the oven to clean....I guess?</p>

<p>tl:dr: I assumed a sex toy was silicone and tried to clean it at a high temp in my oven to remove smell. Turns out it was PVC which creates toxic chemical fumes when heated/burned. I could have died and killed my pet by a melting dildo.</p>

Unfortunately it couldn&#39;t even happen on my cake day, but I figured it was worth putting on here because it&#39;s funny and I could use some tech support advice.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was using the toilet like I normally do in the mornings, and watching YouTube while I do it because I&#39;m addicted to technology. Everything was going fine until it was time to wipe, and as a standing wiper, I was obviously not seated for this portion. So I rested my phone on the counter while listening the remainder of the video I was watching as I start to wipe, but out of nowhere a gnat flies right up to my face. Now as a rational thinker, and a man with extraordinarily fast reflexes, I swat at the gnat, miss it entirely, smack my headphones that are plugged in instead, which yanks on my iPhone and pulls it directly into a toilet bowl full of my own excrement. I pulled it out instantly, and the screen still turned on, but remembering the advice of other people who have had their phones submerged in water, (although often under less shitty circumstances) I have it sitting next to me in a bag of rice. I have no idea how I&#39;m going to get the smell out of it later, but hopefully I can keep this phone and not get pink eye from it when all is said and done because I for sure can&#39;t afford a new one lol.</p>

<p>I considered taking out the gnat for good, but I&#39;m thinking that if I let him go, maybe karma will help save my phone. Anyway, I hope this post brightened someone else&#39;s day because I feel terrible lol.</p>

<p>TL;DR - I dropped my phone in a poop-filled toilet.</p>

My girlfriend and I were laying the couch after a long day just watching a movie. She asked me to rub her back so I lay next to her and start doing my thing which turned into some titty nibbling’ and carpet munching. Next thing we’re screwing hard on the couch. She’s off the edge and I’m on the ground just plowing away. She’s moaning loud. </p>

<p>She finishes and I’m still thrusting about to bust and I hear “mommy?”. I look up and her 7 year old daughter is standing in the doorway and we make eye contact. I’m mortified. I just let out an “oh shit”. I fall to the floor to ensure she doesn’t see anything. </p>

<p>She screams at us and starts saying “I hate you I hate you” and runs off crying. Gf goes after her and calms her down. She calls me into the room and says, “I told her you were giving mommy a massage” (she only saw me without a shirt on). So I come up with a quick story on the spot how I was giving her a massage with my shirt off because I got sweaty from rubbing her back (every night I give her a massage whether it be feet, hands, back etc. So this is actually believable). </p>

<p>Daughter says she just didn’t like seeing me without a shirt on so she’s oblivious thankfully but needless to say we are never fucking on the couch again. </p>

<p>Tldr; Gfs daughter caught us having sex on the couch.</p>

Recently I decided to change it up and add some color, so I went and got some semi permanent box dye and figured it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to do it alone. I don&#39;t exactly know where I went wrong, the dye worked, my hair is purple, I followed the directions, there&#39;s only a tiny bit of dye in the tub. But none of that accounts for the now plum size blad spot on the back of my head🙄 
I did leave the dye on a little bit longer then the instructions said to cause I was caught up in my show (only 5-10mins) but I didn&#39;t think that would do it. It didn&#39;t hurt at all while the dye was on so there was no reason to be alarmed by it and all the reviews said it was great besides being hard to spread. Guess I&#39;m calling the Dr tomorrow </p>

<p>TLDR: Dyed my hair by myself and left it on too long, now im worried I&#39;m gonna lose my hair</p>

I mentioned it in passing to him and he was not thrilled by me taking over his task. I was determined to though and added it to my honey do list. Today was nice weather so I thought I’d get at it and began my scavenger hunt for dog poo. Got all that cleaned up and broke out the old hascavana (idk how to spell it &amp; don’t care to correct) mower. I got it started on the first go. I’ve mowed the lawn several times before so I’ve grown somewhat comfortable with the process and even enjoy it.</p>

<p>Things were going so well…. But then I got too close to the garden bed. We have a pile of rocks near our water outlet. It was there when we moved in, not sure why but we never moved the rocks. They are fairly large. About the size of my hands, which aren’t big but aren’t a small pebble either. I try to get as close to the edges as possible to avoid pulling out the weed eater, which is do not enjoy using unlike the mower. Well I got too close to these rocks and one went right under the mower. It immediately shut off. I thought not big deal, get the rock out from underneath it and restart it. WRONG.</p>

<p>I murdered this lawn mower. I went to restart it and the string had no slack. Bad.Immediately looked up a YouTube video and followed the directions for a seized up lawn mower engine. Unplugged the spark plug and propped the mower up. Tried clearing any blockages and spinning the blades. The blade was hitting the cover at a certain point but I didn’t think much about that. Several attempts at clearing the blades, checking fluids, trying to get it to turn over, I finally called some male relatives and asked for advice.</p>

<p>It was bad. They all agreed I must have knocked the shaft out of alignment, and they all agreed it’s basically scrap metal now. Of course I don’t give up. Back to YouTube academy I go. Watched a few videos about broken shafts, yes that’s in my search history right now. Did the remedies which include taking the blades off, and literally hammering the shaft back into place. I was fully convinced I could fix it but I couldn’t even get the bolt off to remove the blades. I gave it a few whacks with the hammer regardless figuring I have nothing to lose. No dice.</p>

<p>This mower was free from a family member and is 15+ years old and I destroyed it beyond repair. I’m now shopping around for a comparable one, one with a Honda motor, but they’re north of $500. </p>

<p>I now understand why my husband never wants me to mow. I’m a mower murderer. My own grandfather is now referring to me as broken shaft *my first name. </p>

<p>Tl;Dr tried doing my husband a favor by mowing the yard, murdered family lawn mower by running over a rock the size of my hand.</p>

I was in class with this very attractive girl I don’t know super well but well enough to get along with and talk to pretty often. More than acquaintances. She brings up the fact that she doesn’t have a ride home from school later so of course I offer her a ride home. So we get in my car and throughout the ride we just kind of make small talk throughout the whole thing, but something I thought was small talk actually wasn’t and I’m stupid. A few minutes before we get to her house she turns around in her seat and says “wow you have a big backseat… that’s nice…” and I’m just like “yeah you can fit a lot of stuff back there” and then I start another conversation. I get to her house, drop her off, and leave. Didn’t think anything of it until today. I hate myself.</p>

<p>Well applying Icy Hot turns into a massage and I’m pretty sure you can see where this goes. What that said, I rub some lube on and then I start to get this intense burn. OhShit.jpg</p>

<p>Tell my SO we have to stop, I try to wash it off but the damage was done. Slowly for the next hour the intensity of the burning got worse and we debated about going to the ER; However, we both thought they would tell us to wait it out.</p>

<p>So thought I would share why my dicks on fires to spread awareness and some laughs.</p>

<p>TL;DR Make sure you don’t ever put Icy Hot on your dick. It will hurt like hell.</p>

<p>Edit: So ended up taking a sleeping pill and knocking out so it would stop hurting. I appreciate all the suggestions on how to remedy the burning. It finally stopped after I woke up so hope y’all have a good day.</p>

<p>So right before I met her I was watching a video about the russian drug &quot;Krokodil&quot;, idk I watched it because I thought it was interesting and I&#39;ve been following a lot of Real Crime Documentaries and videos alike.</p>

<p>I just closed the app and didnt think much of it. While talking to her something came up regarding Youtube Shorts and how scrolling it for hours made me much more insecure.</p>

<p>I wanted to show her the videos that got recommended to me on Shorts but when I opened the app the thumbnail of said previous video was shown in full display: &quot;HOMEMADE HEROIN&quot;.</p>

<p>She just looked at me, i could tell she was really worried and I was sooo embarassed trying to explain to her that it was not what she that it was. </p>

<p>She nodded and said she believed me but since i had issues with drugs in the past I&#39;m not really sure she actually believed me.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I watched a video about a drug called &quot;Krokodil&quot; and my therapist saw the thumbnail &quot;Homemade Heroin&quot; by accident and got worried.</p>

I gave him some of my cans once and a couple of buds. He told me his name was Dave, that he lived in a tent by a mall, and that he had some kids living nearby.</p>

<p>I saw him this morning carrying a big box of stuff. He said it was a special day for him when I greeted him, so I offered to smoke him out. My apartment is really messy and he offered to help clean it out for some money. It seemed like a fair deal and he did a great job. We worked together to clean basically the whole place. He vacuumed and threw away a lot of trash. He did a lot, but I didn’t want to work him on his birthday, so after 2 hours I paid him $100 and gave him a tv I don’t need. We ate some pizza and watched a movie. He even fell asleep a little. When it was over, he said thanks, left his original box of stuff, and left.</p>

<p>I noticed that my wallet was gone about 15 minutes later. The only things left in there are my debit card and drivers license. I cancelled the card right away, so I’m basically just out an ID and cheap wallet. He didn’t steal anything else out of the apartment.</p>

<p>I really just feel dumb. I can’t believe I was stupid enough to believe this guy and I hope he doesn’t try to break in now that he knows where my stuff is.</p>

<p>TL;DR Tried to make a new friend, got burned and lost a wallet.</p>

<p>*Changed the name and some details, I&#39;m not trying to burn the guy back.</p>

<p>**24 hours later update - Thanks for all the support everyone! This is my first  post to get anywhere near this attention, and I feel grateful.</p>

<p>A lot of people asked if I was sure it was stolen and not lost. I paid the guy after we cleaned and before we watched the movie, so my wallet was definitely there after we moved everything and threw everything away. The order of events makes me think there was no other alternative. I feel confident that it was stolen.</p>

<p>A lot of people called me naïve or gave me advice about being too trusting. I&#39;m definitely going to be more careful about who I bring over in the future, but I refuse to stop interacting with homeless people. I&#39;d rather be myself and get stabbed some day than be terrified and close-minded for 100 years. The man who robbed me doesn&#39;t get to take that away from me too. Neither do mean-spirited Redditors.</p>

<p>I slept really poorly last night and was super nervous at work today. I set up a camera inside my apartment and didn&#39;t see anything all day. The box is still here. I think eventually I&#39;ll just throw it away somewhere else other than the apartment complex. The bongs are super gross and poorly maintained. If he comes back I&#39;ll trade him for my ID and wallet, otherwise I consider our beef to be finished.</p>

<p>Some background: Right now I&#39;m doing the audit shift at my work. We have a system update happening at like 1:00 a.m. this morning. So I had to print everything off like an hour before then. I was mostly worried because I knew I had to print everything before the update tonight. And I think I just tried to overcompensate for that. I ended up just confusing myself. I also really hate wasting things. When I smoke, I refuse to drop my cigarette ends on the ground. I always throw them away properly. I try not to eat a lot for fear of having leftovers that I don&#39;t eat. I&#39;ve stopped drawing on paper just because it goes in the trash. </p>

<p>I accidentally printed out the 60-page report that I was supposed to email. I did email it, but for whatever reason I also printed it out. I was talking to a customer and I wasn&#39;t focusing on what I was doing. </p>

<p>Then, I was wondering why the one 14-page report wouldn&#39;t print. And so I clicked on it a few more times to make sure I was clicking the right button. Then I did it a few more times. Still wouldn&#39;t print.</p>

<p>So I get on the ground to get eye level with the printer so I can find out why it wasn&#39;t printing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when  I found out that the machine was out of paper. And as I filled up the paper tray, I remembered what happens when it runs out of paper. And now it just keeps on printing.</p>

<p>So now I have multiple copies of the same report. Plus the 60-page report from earlier. It comes to 114 pages. I feel like I single-handedly killed a tree. I don&#39;t want to shred a lot of wasted paper. And I can&#39;t turn it all into scrap paper because there&#39;s no more room to store it since we have a ton of that already. Not only that, most of the paper has sensitive information on it.</p>

<p>This may not seem to like a big deal, but I really hate destroying the environment. And wasting things.</p>

<p>TL;DR I printed off 114 pages I didn&#39;t need, and I hate wasting paper.</p>

<p>My little brother (11M) loves corn, and he always asks my parents to boil him some when he&#39;s hungry. Today my mom left some corn boiling before she left for work and told me (16F) to &quot;Check the corn in 15 minutes and turn off the stove if it&#39;s ready&quot;. </p>

<p>I was sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone, waiting and thinking there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll manage to fuck up boiling corn. Minutes pass by and my brother asks me when will the corn be ready, so I stand up and go check if it&#39;s ready. The pot is hot, so I use a kitchen towel to open the lid. The corn doesn&#39;t look ready yet, so I just return to sitting on the couch, not realizing that I left the towel on top of the pot. Minutes later I smell something burning, I look to the kitchen and there&#39;s a fire on the stove. The towel has caught on fire and the sight makes me instantly panic. My little brother freaks out, I grab the burning towel, run to the balcony and throw it on the floor, hitting it repeatedly. Pieces of it fell on my hands and legs and, due to the wind, it managed to get on my hair and a bit of my hair started burning too. I did extinguish it and everything turned out fine, except the kitchen counter that now has a burn mark. And the skin on my leg that burned and I have a scar on it now. And both my hands that now have blisters! And the small chunk of hair that burned off my head.</p>

<p>Now, the fire wasnt huge but it wasn&#39;t tiny either. I think it was dangerously sized and close to flammable stuff so I don&#39;t blame myself for behaving like an idiot and grabbing a flaming item with bare hands. Anyway, the corn turned out good, pretty tasty. </p>

<p><a href="https://ibb.co/0BB4KPL">(tw: burn marks, not really graphic tho)</a></p>

<p>TL;DR: I left a kitchen towel on top of the pot while it was boiling, the towel caught on fire. I panicked and grabbed it with my bare hands, now I have burns/blisters on both my hands, my leg has a burn scar, and a small chunk of my hair burned and fell off. Good times.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood I grew up in, there was a small church. Each year in late May/early June the Church would build a covered platform stage in the parking lot for the purposes of holding services outside during the Summer months. This was back in the early 80&#39;s, long before the days of the internet. As was common practice pretty well EVERYWHERE at the time, teenagers would congregate in various size groups at varying locations. </p>

<p>One day, for whatever reason, there was a group of us hanging out handy to the Church. Eventually the group drifted over in the parking lot to where the platform was. Then someone noticed there was a way to get underneath of the platform, and a bunch of us went under. While under there we realized that we could not be seen from the outside as we were completely hidden. </p>

<p>Word quickly spread amongst the teenagers about the newly discovered haven. &quot;The Platform&quot;, as it soon became known, quickly became a den of debauchery for all of the neighbourhood teens. As we were hidden under there, all kinds of frowned upon teenage behaviours such as drinking, smoking dope, making out, and actual sex went on under there. At the time for us teenagers, &quot;The Platform&quot; seemed to be the greatest discovery ever made! Us teenagers were VERY diligent at keeping The Platform a secret from the adults. We did not want them to find out about The Platform, as that would be the quick and sudden end of The Platform like a train&#39;s screeching locked wheels throwing sparks everywhere! Also, in the effort for The Platform not to be found out about, we made the agreement that no one would go under there on Sundays as that was the day Church Services were held...........At least everyone SAID they would agree to that......... </p>

<p>One Sunday morning found four of us under The Platform. Aged 15 and 16, 3 guys and 1 girl. The plan was to leave before the cars started arriving so we wouldn&#39;t get caught. We were doing our usual thing, someone snuck some beer from home, we were smoking cigarettes and pot, carrying on like teenagers do. One person had a deck of cards in their pocket, so, of course, a game of strip poker broke out. We got so carried away in having a good time that we lost track of time. </p>

<p>Then the good time was suddenly shattered when we heard a car pull into the parking lot, followed by another. A combined and unified look of panic spread across our four faces. What are we going to do? We quickly decided that we couldn&#39;t leave and consoled ourselves we would have to remain under there in silence for the ENTIRE Church Service, until the very last car had left the parking lot, HOWEVER LONG that may take. So we sat there for a few minutes in silence looking at each other, when the person holding the cards started to deal out a hand. After all, just because we had to sit in silence, and there was soon to be a Church Service going on merely inches above our heads didn&#39;t mean we couldn&#39;t continue our strip poker! We all giggled quietly at the thought of a Church Service being held while the four of us were sitting right underneath of it playing strip poker. We could tell the parking lot was getting quite full of cars and the Service would begin any minute, when all of a sudden, out of nowhere, a HUGE gust of wind knocked the platform over, exposing the four of us teenagers, all in various states of undress to the SHOCKED onlookers sitting in their cars! A loud gasp emanated from the crowd as the dumbfounded four of us started scrambling to pick up our clothes amongst scattered liquor bottles everywhere before proceeding to take off like four bats out of hell! Needless to say, that brought a sad end to The Platform, and some say a sad end to an era. </p>

<p>TL;DR - I fucked up by playing strip poker under a Church platform which blew over just before the Service began exposing four half naked teenagers to a group of shocked Church goers.</p>

So I visit them on weekends to help clean up, water the lawn, wash the dishes, etc.</p>

<p>My mom&#39;s pride and joy, for her entire adult life, has been the lush and striking garden she&#39;s kept in their backyard for decades. But our state is under water restrictions right now, so she&#39;s been forced to stop watering the lawn on most days. As a result, my parents&#39; lawn started to die off, and huge, unsightly dead patches made the lawn look like shit.</p>

<p>Stupidly, without doing any research, I bought some grass seed from a supplier on Amazon I wasn&#39;t familiar with. I sprinkled the seed around the dead patches in my parents&#39; lawn, watered over them, and they germinated very quickly. I&#39;d done it! I&#39;d saved the grass!</p>

<p>Turns out that roughly 50% of the seed was actual grass seed, and the remaining 50% was assorted weeds (some of them toxic). The weeds quickly choked out and outcompeted the grass. Then they clumped together so densely that they retained moisture day and night. This led to the outbreak of a massive fungal infection across the weed patches. The infection spread to the rest of the lawn practically overnight, and soon it had overtaken all the trees and flowers in the garden.</p>

<p>All that remains of the garden, at this point, is a massive expanse of rotting, putrid, dead-grass detritus and the legions of flies that swarm around it.</p>

<p>TLDR: TIFU by introducing a fungal infection into my parents&#39; yard, which killed off their entire garden.</p>

<p>My brother and I are fans of the show The Mandalorian.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when he came over, we talked about the show a little bit. He was telling me how he didn&#39;t know The Mandalorian actor was Pedro Pascal until the character removed his helmet many episodes later into the show.</p>

<p>A little backstory: I&#39;m that person who likes to look up articles and facts about a show after I&#39;ve watched them, just because.</p>

<p>So I came across The Mandalorian Wikipedia article that says, in some episodes, it wasn&#39;t even Pedro Pascal in the suit at all. They use body doubles throughout the ENTIRE episode, with Pedro Pascal&#39;s voice later dubbed in.</p>

<p>Obviously for the action scenes it would make sense that they use body doubles, but the article says that some entire episodes don&#39;t have Pedro Pascal at all in the suit.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen the show, you would know that a lot of times, the acting is not via any dialogue, but with gestures such as nodding the head, looking up at someone etc. Knowing that these key moments might not have been played by Pedro Pascal is kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>I told this to my brother and he was so disappointed. He said he would never be able to enjoy the show the same way again knowing this.</p>

<p>He was looking forward to Season 3.</p>

<p>I understand his feelings, because I was disappointed as well when I found out. But ultimately, it is what it is. We need to learn to accept the truth, no matter how disappointing it may be.</p>

<p>I hope he gets over it eventually.</p>

<p>Tldr: I told my brother that in some episodes of The Mandalorian, Pedro Pascal is not in the suit at all. Knowing this kinda ruined the show for him.</p>

We’ve been talking ever since and I really liked her. We’ve been on multiple dates that lasted hours long. She is cute, seems very clean, smells good.</p>

<p>Today, we went out for a drink but we loved each other’s company so a drink turned to tons of cocktails. She was quite drunk and didn’t seem like she could go back home. I offered she can crash at my place and she accepted.</p>

<p>Later at home, we were both drunk and started making out. We both planned to take things slow but one thing lead to another and we didn’t want to stop.
I am an ass man and I am all for eating ass. As I started going down from the lips to the cheeks, I tasted something which felt like a chemical.
It felt weird but I kept going.</p>

<p>Until, I saw a weird bump down there of approximately 1 inch draining some yellow and white puss out of it.
I freaked out and knew I was tasting something weird.
The puss was all over between her cheeks and I was eating it since the past few minutes.
I felt like puking but I did not want to make her uncomfortable.
I asked her what it was, and she said she has a pilonidal cyst which drains once in a while but she didn’t know it would drain today out of all days.
I asked her why she didn’t tell me about it and she said she forgot she had it.</p>

<p>TL;DR I fucked up by going down a woman and eating the pus from a pilonidal cyst</p>

<p>UPDATE- 
It’s crazy how a lot of people don’t know what a sneaker event is- it’s a hobby!! People who are sneaker enthusiasts and spend tons of money on it gather together to showcase their sneakers/swap them/ or buy new ones while getting a few drinks and good music.</p>

<p>Major update- 
so goes without saying, we didn’t have sex because I rushed to stuff my face with bottle(s) of mouthwash. I took an antibiotic just to be safe. I avoided the conversation to not make it more weird than it had already gotten. 
She brought it up the next morning and said she was sorry she couldn’t tell me coz she was too embarrassed, and she didn’t think we would do the deed or she’d be staying over, and that she was too drunk to realise I might go that far.
She didn’t want to stop me and ruin the mood.</p>

<p>I read details about the pilonidal cyst and asked her to get a surgery and she said she will.
We are now planning on a doctor’s appointment to get it checked, so hopefully getting it removed in the next week.</p>

<p>And, I’M FINALLY OUT OF THE FETISH OF GOING DOWN BROWN TOWN</p>
