<p>Hello, all. During the month of August, we will be doing things a little different as the sub book club will be reading two <strong>graphic novels</strong>. The first is <strong>The Many Deaths of Laila Starr</strong> (all five parts) by Ram V. and the second is <strong>The One Hundred Nights of Hero</strong> by Isabel Greenberg! Each week there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Ram and Isabel will each join us for their own AMA.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58673883-the-many-deaths-of-laila-starr?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=kGELQlSjh9&amp;rank=1">Goodreads</a> for <strong>The Many Deaths of Laila Starr</strong> (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humanity is on the verge of discovering immortality. As a result, the avatar of Death is cast down to Earth to live a mortal life in Mumbai as twenty-something Laila Starr. Struggling with her newfound mortality, Laila has found a way to be placed in the time and place where the creator of immortality will be born. Will Laila take her chance to stop mankind from permanently altering the cycle of life, or will death really become a thing of the past? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28433627-the-one-hundred-nights-of-hero">Goodreads</a> for <strong>The One Hundred Nights of Hero</strong> (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Empire of Migdal Bavel, Cherry is married to Jerome, a wicked man who makes a diabolical wager with his friend Manfred: if Manfred can seduce Cherry in one hundred nights, he can have his castle—and Cherry.<br/>
But what Jerome doesn&#39;t know is that Cherry is in love with her maid Hero. The two women hatch a plan: Hero, a member of the League of Secret Story Tellers, will distract Manfred by regaling him with a mesmerizing tale each night for 100 nights, keeping him at bay. Those tales are beautifully depicted here, touching on themes of love and betrayal and loyalty and madness. </p>

The main character is insufferable. It was such an irritating slog as she narrated every minute detail of social interactions and every which way she felt which was wildly unpredictable. I could not stand her, she&#39;s exactly the kind of person I find most irritating lol. The worst part was that she is the most sympathetic character of the story. Everyone else is way worse.</p>

<p>Despite the unpredictable emotions and behaviors of the characters, the plot was bland and somehow kind of predictable. I kept waiting for some kind of twist to make it interesting or some sort of hint at what exactly is going on and why there are such a thing as donors or carers etc in the first place other than that they just do. The bizarre nature of the setting is never explained in any sort of satisfying or meaningful way.</p>

<p>I rarely dislike books and I almost always feel like i &quot;get it&quot; but this one left me clueless. Did anybody
like it or can anyone explain what I&#39;m missing here?</p>

<p>Edit: okay I wrote this immediately after finishing it and was being a bit dramatic lol. I like everybody&#39;s comments, it&#39;s a well written book and the parts I don&#39;t like seem intentional. I dislike the characters and I think that the setting adds nothing to the story but maybe this book is kinda like an abstract painting in that the reaction it elicits is what makes it well executed.</p>

Dragons ? Of course. Elves, Dwarves, Necromancers ? They’re here. Moreover you will encounter an intelligent maze, multiple interconnected worlds, magic, runes, flying boats, intrigues, deep characters and mythology. 
I don’t want to spoil anything so I won’t give you the plot.
If any scenarist have had the intelligence to adapt it, we would already be flooded by movies, series, derived products and so on.
This post is not a suggestion to read, it is an injonction to read. 
I’d be really happy to answer any question / discuss about this series of books.</p>

<p>P.S. : My goal is to testify of my enthusiasm, I hope it doesn’t break any rule. Regards.</p>

 was people who slap a five star review on a book if they enjoyed it and then move
 on with their lives. (Although, I question whether or not people who care so
 little about book reviewing would even use goodreads since it seems it seems like

<p>there shouldn’t be this many people who just leave 5 stars by default. It would
 have to be almost half of the app’s users doing this to create the massive
 quantity of five star reviews every book on the website has. I feel like I maybe
 give 1/7 of the books I rate five stars? And when I look at my friends on the app
 they seem to have a comparable five star ratio. If we are representative of the

<p>Think Stephen King&#39;s Maine or Philip Roth&#39;s New Jersey or Louise Erdrich&#39;s Minnesota or even Honore de Balzac&#39;s Paris. Each one of them essentially invent the specific locations for the rest of the world. They make you feel as if these places you&#39;ve never been to are as familiar as your own city. Or, alternatively, if you do know these places, there are all kinds of little Easter Eggs.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites from lesser known authors who I feel capture a place very well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25182834-black-gum?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=xXZqZI7n3J&amp;rank=1">J David Osborne&#39;s Black Gum</a> and its sequels feel so lived in. They&#39;re very slice of life novels where he just puts characters together. But it&#39;s hypnotic. And his version of Oklahoma feels like home.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57776383-hurricane-season">Kelby Losack&#39;s Hurricane Season</a> begins like a crime novel, but the character&#39;s get stuck in a huge flood with a bunch of drugs but nothing else. There&#39;s something so simple about this novel, but it just flows so pleasantly. It&#39;s weird and haunted, but also lived in. This is at the Gulf Coast and even though most of it is underwater for the bulk of the novel, it just feels like it comes from a deep connection to a place.</li>
<li>Speaking of a deep connection to a place, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61958373-ghosts-of-east-baltimore">David Simmons The Ghosts of East Baltimore</a> actually taught me a lot about Baltimore that I didn&#39;t know. Even though it&#39;s deeply enmeshed with the politics and history of the city, it also throws in cosmic horror, noir, and strange cults to tell one of the wildest stories I&#39;ve encountered in a long time.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61931049-black-gypsies">Grant Wamack&#39;s Black Gypsies</a> brings a different kind of Chicago to life. It&#39;s not the wealthy elite that make Chicago a playground, but it&#39;s also not a story purely about gangs on the Southside. Instead it&#39;s just a story of people on the edges of gangland trying to live life and get by without getting pulled down and under.</li>
</ul>

<p>Who are some of your favorites?</p>

Also, please note that for the sake of understanding the points I&#39;m making here, there will be some details shared from the book that could count as spoiling, though I&#39;ll do my best to stay away from the plot details.</p>

<p>So, just a few days ago, one of the biggest BookTok books of the year finally made its release: Lightlark by Alex Aster. For those who haven&#39;t heard, the story is about 6 rulers of different realms who go to the island, Lightlark, which appears every 100 years, and fight to try and break their realm&#39;s curses. One ruler must die, and the rest. The author apparently wrote the book, got rejected several times, then reached out to TikTok with her pitch and went viral that not only did she get international publishing, she got paid six figures and a film deal. Plus, the book has apparently been praised by well known authors such as Marissa Meyer.</p>

<p>Just from all of this, of course everyone would believe that the book would have to be super amazing, right. Well, after its release the other day, many readers like myself have found it to be the opposite. The Goodreads page for it has already rated it 2.9 out of 5 stars. </p>

<p>Basically, the main problems lie with these points (I will try to keep it short and not too spoil too much): </p>

<ul>
<li>The worldbuilding: The story&#39;s worldbuilding has many gaps and confusions. Some people are trashing the idea of a &quot;starstick,&quot; which is the MC&#39;s portal stick that allows her to travel to other realms through a portal of stars. I don&#39;t see this as much of an issue, though one thing that definitely confuses me is that at the very beginning, the author states that there&#39;s only 6 realms, but apparently whichever ruler dies so does their entire realm. It doesn&#39;t make sense why that happens, especially since the Lightlark battle appears every 100 years, and there&#39;s already been other rulers that have attended these games. It seems like the author was changing her mind about certain things halfway through the book. It also feels like more explanations are needed about the worldbuilding, and I hope the author finds a way to make everything clear and concise.</li>
<li>The inaccurate storyline: Lightlark has been made to sound like it&#39;s the next Hunger Games, mixed with fantasy, filled with fights and adventure. However, it&#39;s not entirely true. While the intention of the story is for one ruler to die and the rest break their curses, there is barely any fighting being done. In fact, a lot of the time the MC, Isla, spends her time in other realms, going on and off Lightlark. Also, the &quot;enemies to lovers&quot; trope with a big argument scene or something that the author was promoting on TikTok doesn&#39;t actually happen. The character development lacks quite a bit and the relationship between Isla and one love interest is super cringey and not at all realistic. With the way the storyline was written, it seems like the marketing was misleading about what the story actually was about. A lot of people have been calling out the author on false advertising which is really not a great start.</li>
<li>The writing itself: I know that this is the author&#39;s first YA novel, and she previously wrote children&#39;s novels, but the writing style was very repetitive and the descriptions of things kind of didn&#39;t make sense. Words like &quot;grinning&quot; or describing the sun as an egg yolk constantly. Not to mention the way Isla describes her realm - the Wildlings - all the time, and how they are seen as monsters which is a true fact. Then the characters are also terribly written. Isla is meant to seem like she&#39;s cunning and a liar fooling everyone, that at any moment she will turn around and attack, but instead she&#39;s impulsive and lets her emotions get in the way of things.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is only the gist of things. I could continue on but this post would be super long. Overall, I don&#39;t understand how the editors allowed this to be published, or the writer not be concise with her plot and worldbuilding. I think the premise was a good idea, but just not well executed. Let me know your thoughts if you have or haven&#39;t read Lightlark.</p>

But turns out he did &quot;read&quot; the book, except he skipped &quot;boring passages&quot; and browsed most of the book, which is why he had finished reading it in less than a week.</p>

<p>It got me thinking at what point can someone claim to have read a book. Do you need to have actually read the words, read 95% of the book for instance? If you are speedreading, do you need to have understood most of it? Can I claim to have read Moby-Dick if I didn&#39;t understand 75% of it and was just speeding through it so I can add it to my list of accomplishments?</p>

<p>Perhaps you think <em>who cares, let people say what they want!</em> I&#39;m not judging that person (or trying not to; maybe I do sound judgy). I do understand that we all have different abilities, and there is nothing wrong with trying to browse a tough book as a challenge, even if you don&#39;t get most of it or skip chapters. But to say you have read a book, that sort of makes people expect that you read most of it and understood it, unless you claim otherwise.</p>

<p>Just my opinion.</p>

Catcher in the Rye receives a lot of criticism because Holden is a misanthropic, edgy teenager, but do people realize that this is a portrait of a psychological make-up of a traumatized and frustrated adolescent?</p>

<p>As I got older and gained more experience in the world, I think CitR made me realize how we often dismiss the mental well-beings of adolescents (especially male adolescents) and how they feel eternally trapped (while deluding themselves that they&#39;re different and better than the rest) as a result.</p>

It follows the exploits of Political Commissar Ibram Gaunt as he and his command, the Tanith First and Only, fight their way through a brutal campaign to claim the Sabbat system for the Imperium.</p>

<p>Before this, I didn&#39;t quite get the allure of WH40K. I could understand the context of it: it was created during a really dark period of the 80&#39;s in Thatcher era Britain, itself in the context of the Cold War. But I couldn&#39;t understand why people loved it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a hopeless setting. The Imperium is a villain protagonist, everyone else ranges from morally gray at best to cacklingly evil at worst. And sometimes the Imperium itself is all of those things! </p>

<p>But reading about Gaunt and his men, and their struggle against titanic odds, I get it. Is WH40K full of epic and awesome battles? Yes. Is the lore deep and wide? Yes. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s also about people. People who, despite being surrounded by horrors of all types and flavors, remain human. They still work to get by, to survive. They aren&#39;t flat people in a pastiche universe, but have the same depth that we do. They have depth to their souls, and not even Chaos can take that away from all of them.</p>

<p>If I had to sum it up it all up in three words, they would be, &quot;Somehow, we manage.&quot;</p>

<p>I was at the liquor store and the clerk was reading Darryl. I asked what it was about and they got nervous but also excited, said it was excellent and odd and about a cuckold who was exploring gender and sexuality. I was in need of something different and picked it up.</p>

<p>I almost put it down within the first 15% or so. I didn&#39;t realize when I bought it that it was journal-style, with zero actual dialogue/scenes. It was hard to get into. I was enjoying the story (I&#39;m hesitant to say plot, although there is one, but it doesn&#39;t come up until about halfway), but I kept thinking &quot;this would be so much better with a normal approach.&quot; </p>

<p>Regardless, it kept me just sucked in enough to keep going, and I&#39;m so glad I did! Around 50% I was fully sucked in and had &quot;gotten over&quot; the journaling style. The plot comes around, the characters are super interesting, and they, to me, feel like real people, even though it would have been super easy to fall onto tropes, especially because many of the characters are a different gender minority or into highly specific kinks.</p>

<p>I was so happy that <span class="md-spoiler-text">the main character and his wife end up pretty wholesomely on the same team, despite the unusual relationship. I was expecting it to be a typical kink-leads-to-catastrophe story, which it risked becoming, but never did. Well, it sort of did, but fuck Moonbeam, am I right?</span></p>

<p>It was also pretty fun from the generational perspective, as I&#39;m about the same age as the main character, and it was fascinating seeing his mind open about identities while also scoffing at the centrality with which he thought the younger generation placed it. It totally captured my generation&#39;s view. </p>

<p>Highly recommend!</p>
