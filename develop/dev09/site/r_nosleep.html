She was kind, considerate, understanding, and helpful; she had all the attributes that you would want in a friend. She once spotted a person begging for food on our way out of the grocery store and walked back in to buy them one of those pre-packaged lunches as well as a drink and a dessert. </p>

<p>I was always in awe of my wife’s acts of kindness and incredibly grateful that I had found her. She always made sure to do the laundry every week, which included ironing all of my work clothes and folding or hanging everything up so it would be good to go for the upcoming work week. She would remind me about big events that didn’t even concern her; like my mother&#39;s birthday or my niece’s school dance recital. If it wasn’t for her I’d be fucked when it comes to most areas of my life. But that’s just how we balance each other out; I&#39;m a dunce she pays attention to details and makes sure that I don’t miss important dates.</p>

<p>I don’t know what caused the sudden change in her attitude; I’ve tried to pinpoint it down to one specific event, one specific day, but so far I haven’t had much luck. </p>

<p>I do have a very vivid memory of when I first noticed the biggest change, however. </p>

<p>I had gotten a call at work. It was from my mother, and she wanted to know if my wife and I would be bringing anything to the family dinner that weekend. I, of course, was confused as I had no memory of a family dinner being discussed. Upon hearing this, my mother became annoyed, saying we had discussed this just two weeks ago when we got together for my cousin Jolene’s birthday. </p>

<p>I was also getting annoyed at this point. Firstly because my mother was calling me at work while I was busy, but also because my wife, who was always on top of stuff like this had somehow forgotten to give me a heads-up. </p>

<p>“Look, mom, I can’t really talk right now. I’ll discuss this with Quinn when I get home and I’ll call you when we figure something out,” I replied as I turned back to the pile of documents I was trying to get through. </p>

<p>“Fine Tony, whatever. Just make sure you let me know by the end of the day so I can go buy whatever we might be missing.”</p>

<p>I hung up the phone as I tried to ignore my frustration. Unable to completely brush it off, however, I picked up my phone again and sent Quinn a text: My mom called. She wants to know what we’re bringing to dinner??? Didn’t even know a dinner was happening, thanks for filling me in I guess. </p>

<p>In hindsight, the message was probably unnecessary, and albeit a little passive-aggressive, but at the time all that I could focus on was the fact that my normally responsible wife had caused me to get scolded by my mother while at work. </p>

<p>That evening when I got home, the house was quiet. </p>

<p>Normally, at this hour, Quinn would be finishing up dinner but I walked into the kitchen to find two pots on the stove while my wife was nowhere in sight. </p>

<p>I approached the stove and lifted the lid on the pots. The first one had some boxed mac and cheese that had cooled down enough for it to get all dry and clumpy. The second one had steamed broccoli. </p>

<p>I set my phone and my keys down on the kitchen table and made my way upstairs to look for my wife.</p>

<p>I found her in our bed, laying with her back to me with a blanket pulled up over her head. </p>

<p>“Quinn?” I asked. </p>

<p>She didn’t reply. </p>

<p>I took my shoes off and approached the bed, reaching out to shake her. </p>

<p>“Quinn, are you asleep?” I asked. </p>

<p>She sighed. “Not anymore.”</p>

<p>I walked around the bed towards the bathroom, getting out of my work clothes and stepping over the clothing as it fell on the floor around my feet. </p>

<p>“Did you get my text?” I asked. </p>

<p>She still hadn’t moved but I could see her face now and she was staring off into space. </p>

<p>“Quinn? Did you see my text?” I repeated. </p>

<p>Her eyes flickered over to me for a second before she looked away again. </p>

<p>“Yeah, I got the text,” she replied, annoyed. </p>

<p>“Okay, well, we need to figure out what we’re gonna do and call my mom back.”</p>

<p>Quinn sat up as I began walking into the bathroom. </p>

<p>“We? Or me?” She asked. </p>

<p>“What?” I called as I turned the shower on. </p>

<p>She said nothing in return, so I stepped into the shower, thinking that maybe I had misheard her. </p>

<p>When I got out of the shower, she was no longer in bed. I dried off and walked towards the dresser to look for some clothes to change into, tripping over my work pants on the way. </p>

<p>I huffed, annoyed as I kicked them out of the way, towards the laundry hamper. </p>

<p>Once I had changed, I made my way back downstairs and into the kitchen. I spotted Quinn sitting on the living room couch, looking down at her phone. </p>

<p>I opened the fridge, scanning the contents for a few seconds before closing it and walking into the living room. </p>

<p>“Hey babe, do we have anything to eat?” I asked. </p>

<p>“Yeah, there’s mac and cheese on the stove. And some vegetables,” she replied, not once looking up from her phone. </p>

<p>“Boxed mac and cheese isn’t really a meal,” I pointed out. </p>

<p>“Okay, so eat the veggies then.”</p>

<p>I stared at her but she didn’t even seem to notice. </p>

<p>“Babe, you know I’m not a huge fan of broccoli…” I replied. </p>

<p>Quinn finally looked up, glaring at me. “So starve for all I care,” she snapped. </p>

<p>She got up and marched back upstairs after that, slamming the door to her office shut as I stood there speechless. </p>

<p>I didn’t know what to do or say as her reaction had caught me completely off guard. I ended up eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that night and sleeping in our bed by myself. </p>

<p>The following morning, Quinn stayed in her office as I got ready for work, running around trying to pack up all of my stuff, and get dressed, and make coffee <em>and</em> get some breakfast. </p>

<p>When I finally made it out the door, I was pissed. I didn’t know what had gotten into her recently, and for the rest of the day, I walked around frustrated, annoyed, and tired. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, my mother texted me during my lunch break to follow up about the dinner. I ignored her message and turned my phone off for the remainder of my shift. </p>

<p>Over the next few days, I would see Quinn sitting around the house. Every day when I got home was the same, however. I would come back to either no dinner or random leftovers of whatever she had eaten. She would ignore me most of the time, only talking to me when I asked her a question directly. Most of the time though, I would find her looking at her phone or locked away in her office doing God knows what. </p>

<p>One Saturday morning, I saw her doing yoga in her office with the door open. </p>

<p>I stood in the doorway as she followed along to a video she had pulled up on her laptop. </p>

<p>She turned to face me as she bent over in a stretch and closed her eyes when she saw me. </p>

<p>“Did you make any coffee?” I asked, breaking the silence. </p>

<p>She kept her eyes closed as she changed positions, stretching to the other side. </p>

<p>“I don’t even drink coffee, Tony.”</p>

<p>I watched her for a few seconds as she stood up and lifted one of her legs, leaning forward and opening her arms. </p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” I asked. </p>

<p>Her head turned towards me quickly. “I don’t fucking like coffee.”</p>

<p>I said nothing as she continued on with her routine, watching her for a few moments. </p>

<p>“You know,” I finally said. “You really need to calm the fuck down. Maybe the yoga was a good idea.”</p>

<p>I turned and walked out of the room after that, not bothering to hear her response. Not that she would have given me one anyway. </p>

<p>We didn’t speak for the rest of that day, and we also never made it to the family dinner. I, of course, received calls from family members wondering where we were. Feeling petty, I decided to tell them that it was Quinn’s fault; that she was the one who didn’t want to see them. </p>

<p>I realized my mistake very quickly when she threw open her office door and marched downstairs and stood in front of the television as I was in the middle of a movie. </p>

<p>“Can you move?” I asked. </p>

<p>“Did you tell your fucking parents that I didn’t want to see them?!” She demanded. </p>

<p>I sighed as I watched the screen around her body. </p>

<p>“You’ve got the be fucking kidding me,” she laughed flatly. </p>

<p>“Well, it’s the truth, isn’t it? You didn’t mention it, you wouldn’t talk about it, so what was I supposed to do?”</p>

<p>She crossed her arms over her chest. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe think of something yourself for once instead of relying on me or your mom to do everything for you?” </p>

<p>I rolled my eyes. “You know, you’ve been acting like a bitch lately and I don’t appreciate it. This…” I motioned towards her vaguely “...is not the person I married.”</p>

<p>Quinn stood there for a second, nodding at me before she turned around and left again. </p>

<p>The next morning, it all went to shit. </p>

<p>When I woke up, Quinn was in the kitchen, walking around stirring and flipping things in pans on the stove. I thought we were back to normal for a second, and walked in, ready to eat.</p>

<p>“Good morning babe,” I said, approaching the kitchen counter. </p>

<p>At the sound of my voice, Quinn turned around to face me and my breath caught in my throat as I looked at her. </p>

<p>Her face had changed. She still had <em>her</em> face, except it was different, weird, terrifying. One-half of her face was done up with makeup. It was cheery; that side of her mouth was turned up in a smile and her eye looked kind as she looked at me. The other side of her face, however, was contorted into a sneer. It was not a facial expression that a regular human would make, instead, her eyebrow was furrowed aggressively and her eye was wide and twitching in anger and dark red as if she hadn’t slept in hours. Her nose was even wrinkled and turned up and that half of her upper lip was lifted, exposing her teeth slightly. </p>

<p>She looked furious; angrier than I had ever seen anyone look. She looked like a monster. </p>

<p>“What’s wrong babe? Don’t you want some quiche?” The happy side of her face asked me. </p>

<p>When it spoke, the left side of her mouth did not move, and yet her speech wasn’t hindered in any way. </p>

<p>I didn’t reply, I <em>couldn’t</em> reply. I was still in shock. I wasn’t sure whether I should scream or cry. </p>

<p>“Are you gonna fucking answer or what?!” The other side of her face snapped. </p>

<p>“N-no thank you,” I stuttered. “I don’t want any.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” the happy side said, disappointed. “Well, I can make you something else if you want. Do you want pancakes?” </p>

<p>The other side laughed. “You’re such a fucking loser.”</p>

<p>I stepped away from the counter and backed out of the room.</p>

<p>“Let me know if you want anything else!” She called after me. </p>

<p>I hurried back up into our bedroom and shut the door, leaning against it. </p>

<p>I don’t know how long I stayed up there, but eventually, I was too hungry to continue hiding out and ended up walking back into the kitchen. </p>

<p>Quinn was still in there, sitting at the table. Both halves of her face looked at me when I came in. </p>

<p>“There’s some quiche still. And I also make pancakes for you in case you wanted those instead” she said. </p>

<p>The other side of her face rolled its eye. </p>

<p>I walked over and grabbed some pancakes, not really trusting that she hadn’t poisoned them. </p>

<p>I ate in silence as I sat across the table from her. </p>

<p>“Tony, why won’t you look at me?” The nice side asked. </p>

<p>I glanced up at her. “I am looking at you.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been avoiding me all morning,” she said. </p>

<p>“I’m just tired.”</p>

<p>I could feel her gaze on me as I kept eating, and tried to ignore it.</p>

<p>Once I was done, I put my plate in the sink and quickly walked out of the kitchen again and into the living room where I sat on the couch to watch some TV. I thought about what I should do at that moment. How was I supposed to fix her? Could this even be fixed? She was the one who always had the answers to our problems. </p>

<p>I heard the faucet running and the sound of drawers being opened and closed as she put away the leftovers. I wasn’t even sure if she had eaten yet. </p>

<p>After a while, she walked into the living room and sat down right next to me. I kept my vision forward trying to avoid her. </p>

<p>“Tony…” she sang. </p>

<p>I remained laser-focused on the TV. </p>

<p>She reached her hand up and turned my face to look at her. I felt nauseated as I looked at her face. Or faces. It was even worse up close. It looked fake like she had on some weird mask. The good side of her smiled at me and suddenly she was leaning in. I was unable to move back quickly enough and soon her lips were pressed against mine. </p>

<p>I stayed still until I felt her teeth bite down on my lip. </p>

<p>“Ouch!” I mumbled. </p>

<p>She bit harder. </p>

<p>“Ow!” I yelled, pulling back. </p>

<p>She kept biting, moving her teeth back and forth like she was trying to saw through my lip. I shouted as I pushed her back, but she was freakishly strong for some reason. </p>

<p>I wasn’t able to pull her away until she had bitten off a piece of my lip. I stood up off the couch as blood ran down my chin, watching the evil side of her face chew my lip a few times before spitting it out at my feet. </p>

<p>“What the fuck!?” I shouted. </p>

<p>The good side of her face kept smiling at me as if nothing had happened. “Did you wanna take this to the bedroom babe?” It asked. </p>

<p>“Fuck no! Do not follow me you crazy bitch!” </p>

<p>I ran out of the living room as my mouth throbbed. I made it into the bedroom, and headed towards the bathroom, tripping over my clothes and landing on my left knee. I closed my eyes and bit my lip in pain, which only added to the pain that was already there. I cried out as I slowly stood up and leaned against the bathroom counter, looking into the mirror. </p>

<p>I looked almost as frightening as Quinn, with a chunk missing off my lip and blood dripping down my chin and throat. It had gotten on my shirt now as well and I took it off, leaning forward to look at the injury in the mirror. </p>

<p>I held my breath as I cleaned the wound to the best of my ability. Once all the blood had been rinsed off the missing part of my lip looked about ten times bigger. I grabbed some gauze and pressed it to the wound to try to stop the bleeding. </p>

<p>I was getting dizzy. I sat down on the floor of the bathroom, pulling open the cabinets under the sink to grab the bottle of alcohol. I opened it and moved the bottle around under my nose to stop myself from passing out. </p>

<p>After a few seconds, the dizziness went away and I leaned my head back against the wall as I set the alcohol down. </p>

<p>I kept pressure on the wound, thinking back to the image of my wife chewing on my skin. </p>

<p>When I opened my eyes again, I gasped. Quinn was crouched down right in front of me, leaning in towards my face. I tried to back up but I was already up against the wall and had nowhere to go. </p>

<p>“Are you okay?” The evil side asked me in a mocking tone. </p>

<p>It no longer just looked angry; now it was amused, almost smirking. </p>

<p>“I’m fine,” I replied. </p>

<p>“Here, let me kiss it better,” the other side offered. </p>

<p>“No!” I snapped. </p>

<p>She backed up, the good side of her face changing too; into a sad expression. </p>

<p>“Why don’t you want me, Tony?” It asked. </p>

<p>“What?” I mumbled.</p>

<p>“I thought this was what you wanted.”</p>

<p>“You thought THIS was what I wanted?!” I asked, motioning at her face. </p>

<p>“He doesn’t like us anymore,” The evil side replied, changing into an exaggerated frown. </p>

<p>“Is that true, Tony?” The other side asked. </p>

<p>“You bit my fucking lip off!” I shouted.</p>

<p>She stood up and looked down at me. “You’ve done a lot worse to me. This is the least that you could live with.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t tell which side of her face said that, and I didn’t really care to know. </p>

<p>She left the room then, but neither of us have left the house. </p>

<p>Quinn’s face is the same, although it goes through moods. Sometimes, she doesn’t stop staring at me for hours; she won’t even blink. </p>

<p>On more than one occasion, I’ve woken up in the middle of the night to find her hovering a mere few inches over me while she stares. Both sides of her face seem to hate me now for some reason. </p>

<p>One morning when I got out of the shower she was standing in the bathroom doorway holding a knife. I thought for sure she was going to kill me; the evil side of her face looked extra angry that day. I think the only reason she didn’t stab me to death was that the opposite side of her was the one holding the knife. </p>

<p>Every day I go to work and come home and she’s the same. I start sweating as soon as I pull into our neighborhood, and yet I don’t know what to do. I think she would track me down if I tried to run. I swear I saw her standing outside of a restaurant last well where I was having a lunch meeting with a client. </p>

<p>My wife used to be a nice person, but now I’m terrified of her.</p>

At first, it was amusing to watch, then it became puzzling, and then aggravating. Every day I’d watch my co-worker take a sip from his coffee mug—the same ivory, obviously hand-crafted coffee mug. He’d take a sizable sip, grimace for at least three to four seconds, and then take <em>another sip</em> after his face had relaxed. He’d repeat this behavior two or three times, then set the mug down and resume his work. Later, perhaps an hour or two, he’d conduct the little ritual again; the intensity of the grimacing never intensifying, but not waning, either.  </p>

<p>Like anyone else, my initial thought was the he had simply added a hefty dose of alcohol to the cup, and was grimacing at the strength of the booze, or the overall taste of the concoction. And, like someone who knows how to mind their own business, I never asked him; never confronted this person who might genuinely need a little <em>extra</em> in his cup to get through the mind-breaking mundanity of our job. But, I’m still a curious person, and couldn’t simply let this assumption ride completely uncomfirmed; especially not since he’d do this every. Single. Day. I’ve never personally known an alcoholic, but his productivity and the quality of his work were not reflective of someone who was always on the edge of a buzz, clinging less and less to sobriety. No offense to alcoholics – I&#39;m sure there are some efficient, perfectly functional ones.  </p>

<p>Subtly—or so I hoped—I started to walk by his desk right after he’d take a sip, but never once did I smell even the faintest scent of booze. Coffee, sure; and something stale and slightly acrid, like burnt sweetener—but never the distinctly pungent scent of alcohol. As far as I was concerned, the man was clean. Something else about the coffee was making him physically wince and go misty-eyed with every sip, and I was determined to find out what.  </p>

<p>There is no coffee maker at our office. The company could easily afford to give us each our own (our manager has a very flashy, assuredly expensive one in his office) but they’ve never supplied the employees with one in our breakroom. And while I can’t speak for everyone, I’ve decided to never shell out the twenty or so bucks to buy a cheap coffeemaker to save everyone the trouble; because I know that’s EXACTLY what the company wants us to do – and I’m too much of a spiteful, petty person to let them win this virtually non-existent squabble. So, I make my coffee at home. The point behind all this is that one day, I thought of a plan to find out once and for all what the hell was in my coworker’s cringe-inducing coffee.  </p>

<p>Leaving my coffee mug in the car—after having gulped down the throat-searing brew, of course—I came into work and said aloud, very close to him, “Dammit, I forgot my coffee.” He had just been in the process of taking a sip from his mug, presumably the first of the day. My little practiced outburst stopped him, and before his lips could touch the cup I followed my little performance up with, “Would you mind if I had a tiny sip of yours? Just to start the day?” I motioned toward the water cooler, on which sat little plastic cups; showing that I wouldn’t even have to infringe upon the surface area of his cup with my stranger lips.  </p>

<p>He stared at me for a moment, inscrutably and silently, and then looked to his cup—intently; as if staring into a depth far greater than that of the 16oz container. Finally, after what had to have been six seconds of weird, uncomfortable silence—he nodded, almost solemnly; as a priest might upon pondering the legitimacy of a frequent sinner’s claim of contrition. Barely containing my morbid excitement, I went and retrieved one of the plastic cups and set it before him. As if pouring a sacramental drop—to further the catholic analogy—there was a genuine air of reverence in how he gently tipped his mug toward the cup to let the black, steaming liquid stream out. Once done, he returned the lid to his mug and slid the plastic cup back to me. I took it, thanked him profusely and sincerely (my curiosity had reached its boiling point) and returned to my desk.  </p>

<p>I didn’t look back at him upon arriving, but I knew that he was watching me. As casually as I could manage—given my palpable excitement—I brought the cup to my lips and took a small sip.  </p>

<p>The experience was unlike anything I could’ve ever imagined, and upon regaining my composure I found myself shocked, profoundly amazed, at how my coworker had so routinely imbibed the liquid, with only a grimace or shudder afterwards.  </p>

<p>The base, fundamental element was coffee, yes. A dark roast, without sugar or cream, brewed strongly. But the drink’s overall potency, its primary affect, was owed not to the caffeine—but to the <em>other</em> element, the thing with which the drink had been spiked. I was not immediately made aware of this singular ingredient, and at the moment could only guess—with hilarious inaccuracy—at its nature; but I knew, before being told later, that it wasn’t something you’d find in any store; and neither was it procurable through any legal means or channels. And as my coworker had done so many times before, I recoiled from it, as if I had instead sipped boiled poison. Its basic taste not necessarily acrid, but more-so slimy and ill-textured; offensive to the palate in multiple ways, none of which I can sufficiently describe.  </p>

<p>But what I can describe, what I can (strangely) give a clear account of, is the resultant feeling, the physical discomfort and mental disclarity of its consumption. The immediate sensation elicited was one of mental displacement. Swallowing the substance brought an abrupt shift in my sense of equilibrium, not dissimilar to missing a step when descending a staircase. That brief, panic-inducing sense of weightlessness, wherein you feel as if you’ve been betrayed by either the architecture of the building or gravity itself. Following on the heels of this was a mounting sense of dread, seemingly source-less, though nonetheless powerful and nerve-firing. I felt the ominous, cataclysm-auguring approach of <em>something</em>; the imminent arrival of a Thing or Entity whose sole and dark-hearted purpose was the end of all terrestrial life. And not just on Earth, but on every biologically inhabited sphere in the cosmos.  </p>

<p>This dread and cosmic anxiety soon gave way to a pitch-black, soul-dampening despair, as I became assured that nothing, no power on Earth would be able to stop the arrival of this ultramundane presence. In a deeply worrying cardiac event, my heart-rate climaxed and then reversed to a glacial, murmurous slowness; I suddenly felt wrapped up in an invisible, languor-inducing web—to await the predatory encroachment of its unhuman weaver. My mind was then filled with visions, fleeting, nebulous, and largely indescribable in their imagery, but carrying the same import of unavoidable doom. Flashes of lightless gulfs, endlessly imploding voids, vast basins filled with volcanic shadows, titanic shards of obliterated worlds floating listlessly in the black vacuity of outer space.... all omening some ultimate undoing of Life. </p>

<p>And through it all, present amidst every abysmal vista, ubiquitous among the horrific scenery, was a figure—sometimes appearing as a solid, tangible thing; and other times as a warped, amorphous fragment of some ultra-human body; the nightmarish memory of something too horrible to maintain a composite form.  </p>

<p>And then, just as abruptly as it had come, the feeling left me. The dread and despair and awful, unplacatable sorrow melted away, and I was back at work—sitting calmly; suddenly instilled with a deep sense of clarity—of peacefulness. I looked into the cup, and saw my normal face reflected back at me. I was sure I would see a terror-stricken, despair-befallen expression; but my face was relaxed, my expression befitting someone who had moments ago been told they would no longer need to worry about some previously confounding problem.  </p>

<p>My coworker’s hand fell on my shoulder, and looking up at him I saw that same expression of total serenity. He smiled, and told me to find him after work. He then returned to his desk, and we separately attended to our tasks for the day.  </p>

<p>The day ended, and as he had asked, I found him waiting outside of the entrance to the building. He told me to follow him home, and without asking why, I complied. I knew immediately that there was more to the peculiar coffee; that the sordid, ineffable half-images and suggestions I had witnessed in my mind held a greater significance.  </p>

<p>He pulled into his driveway and I parked along the road, not expecting to be there for long. He waited for me to exit my car, and then gestured for me to follow him to the garage. First looking around furtively, he motioned for me to stand next to him, and then typed the door’s code into the keypad. The garage began to open, and just when it had risen to about chest level, he gripped me by the shoulders, pulled me down, and flung me inside. I barely managed to get my hands up and prevent myself from falling face-first onto the dusty concrete. I heard him clamber in behind me, and then the reversal of the garage’s motion boomed within the confined space. When it had finally closed, he helped me to my feet and apologized before I could come up with a complaint.  </p>

<p>“It’s better to enter from this way—to see it up front for the first time.”  </p>

<p>Without the evening light of outside, the garage was completely dark, and my coworker told me to wait a moment while he turned on a light. I expected either the dim, barely luminate glow of a cheap bulb, or the harsh, bug-attracting brilliance of a floodlight; but instead, an eerie crimson light filled the room; casting a sanguine gloom upon everything. The objects immediately near me were ordinary: a rusted mountain bike and a pump for its tires; a few unlabeled moving boxes; gardening tools hung on rubber hooks affixed to the left wall; a long metal chest against the right wall, probably containing fishing or hunting equipment. But in stark contrast to these mundane suburban items was the thing against the far wall of the garage, above which was situated the blood-tinged light.  </p>

<p>To put it plainly: It was a head. A massive, extremely rotted head.  </p>

<p>The sheer enormity of it was what I first noticed. It spanned the entire back wall of the garage, lying on its right cheek, facing us. From its intermittently lumpy and cratered scalp, to the tunnel-like stub of its neck, with the left temple almost touching the ceiling. Its skin, sallow and leprous, was taunt against the skull—the physiognomy wholly unidentifiable. The second thing I noticed—and was deeply appalled by—was the advanced state of is decomposition; but not just that, but how it seemed, despite this, to live! Its moldered—or rather, perpetually moldering—skin <em>pulsated,</em> the pustules and gangrenous lumps throbbing hideously; undergoing an impossible inflammation. The severity of its sickness, the undeniable certainty of its death, coupled with these contradictory signs of life reminded me of one of the more solid glimpses of that delirium-haunting figure; and I realized that I was looking at the real, physical form of that gulf-traversing emissary.  </p>

<p>“The Despair Priest. Or Preacher—whichever you prefer. He appeared in my garage one day, while I was watching that old TV. I’d been in a really good mood, had just finished watching a livestream of a Mass from my church back home. I hadn’t found a local one yet. Well, I guess my moment of....<em>triumphant spirituality</em> caught this thing’s attention. It appeared right there, simply manifested as if it had teleported from some other place. Only back then, it’s face hadn’t yet decayed. It was still dying, but there was more life than death in it. I was of course terrified, scared out of my fucking mind, and all the joy and love for the Lord bled out of me in an instant. Dread washed over me—but the most bizarre thing was how <em>good</em> it felt, if that makes sense. It was...intoxicating. The scale of my hopelessness somehow enthralled me.”  </p>

<p>The way he spoke about the experience was almost nostalgic, and I felt my body begin prepare for some kind of fight-or-flight state. His face, serene and pallid, looked deathly in the sanguine light—like a corpse reposed in an alcove within a torch-lit tomb. Not knowing how to respond, I just said, “Well, shit.”  </p>

<p>He nodded, a sorrowful smile spreading across his face, and then continued:  </p>

<p>“I sensed that it was dying; would’ve known even if I hadn’t been able to see the thing. I was also somehow made aware of the fact that it’s purpose was to spread this dread, to fill people with a horrible, terrible despair—wherever it could find them. The Dread Priest, evangelizing the cosmos with intimations and images of hopelessness and nihility. But it was dying, and it couldn’t fulfill this mantle completely. Had it been a little healthier, a little less eroded by rot, it would’ve succeeded in enrapturing me. I would’ve succumbed to an irremediable despair, and been left to.... die, probably. Either through self-neglect and malnutrition, or <em>self-termination</em>. But eventually, I snapped out of it, and left the garage.  </p>

<p>But the feeling still lingered, tiny sorrow-tipped hooks had been embedded in my psyche. Happiness and optimism returned to me eventually, and initially these feelings were more potent than they had ever been before. I felt exultant in my praise for God, joyous in my existence. But these intensities quiclky faded, and I was left dejected and glum. I didn’t want to admit it at first, but I knew I’d have to eventually return to it; that I’d have to eventually expose myself again to that Undying Thing—so that I could immerse myself in its unwholesome radiation, in order to feel the subsequent spiritual ecstasy of its absence.” </p>

<p>It was a monstrous and darkly fantastic story, and I stared at the thing with a new level of disgust. It had come from some far-flung domain of space to spread despair, to bring civilizations to ruin not with cosmic violence or by annihilation of the dominant species, but through an emission of volatile hopelessness; a pervasive broadcast of mortal futility.  </p>

<p>Having an idea, but needing to confirm it, I asked that unspeakable, darkly revelatory question: “What does this have to do with the coffee?”  </p>

<p>My coworker pulled his mug from his pocket (I hadn’t noticed he’d been carrying it with him) and went over to the ghoulish head. As casually as if it were a drink dispenser, he put his cup under one of the ever-seeping pores, until the foul black slime filled it to the brim. Then, without a moment of hesitation, he brought the mug to his lips and took a sip.  </p>

<p>His revulsion was more powerful than I’d ever seen, and he lingered longer than usual in that state of despondent reflection; but he soon recovered, and dumped the rest into the eyeless socket abreast with his shoulder.  </p>

<p>“I only add a little to my morning coffee. If I were to drink a whole cup of this, I’d surely lose myself to that awful sorrow—if it didn’t outright kill me due to some kind of toxicity at high dosages. But yeah, that’s it. I add a little to my coffee, suffer through that micro-dose of despair—and then spend the rest of the day feeling pretty damn good. I have to take a sip here and there, sure; the periods can vary in length, but I’d say it’s still better than just....enduring life as it is, you know? Even with religious optimism, life can really fucking suck, and somedays it’s almost intolerably hard to get up and go to work and <em>exist.</em> At least this way I’m chasing a state of harmless optimism and positivity, rather than some ever-dwindling state of normalcy. It’s even helped me feel closer to God, if you can believe it.”  </p>

<p>While I doubted that final part of his claim, I saw the sense in the rest of it. I had felt <em>good</em> after the clearing of the despair; though I was already feeling a little low, a little deprived of my intoxicant-induced joy. I had so many questions for him. Why keep it? Why not show the authorities, or scientists, or try to destroy it? But as the seconds ticked by, and I smelled the weird, not-right scent of its ceaseless decomposition, I knew that I would’ve refrained from showing anyone else, as well. I wanted another taste—<em>craved</em> the post-trauma clarity and elation. My coworker had been granted a warped miracle, and had the same been done for me, I wouldn’t have told a soul.  </p>

<p>Sensing my desire, he told me to wait there and then went into the house. A few moments later, he returned bearing two cups of steaming coffee.  </p>

<p>“I keep my coffeemaker set to brew up a batch in time with my arrival home. I like to stick to a routine with this stuff.”  </p>

<p>He brought both cups under two separate streams of the sickeningly slushy liquid, only for a moment, and then withdrew them; their surfaces tinged with a deeper darkness than before. Smiling, he extended a cup to me, and I accepted the stygian mix like a dying man accepting his last rites.  </p>

<p>Together we drank, despaired, and, afterwards, danced.</p>

Sorry it’s taken me so long to write this update and thank you for sticking with me since my <a href="https://teddit.net/r/nosleep/comments/wq9nzc/im_filipino_and_our_culture_is_heavily_influenced/">first post</a>. I’ve finally made my decision on what to do about Lola, so I’m writing this update. But first, let me tell you about what happened in the past few days.</p>

<p>Some of you have suggested talking to my grandmother during the day, so I went ahead and did that. It was a bit hard to convince my family to let me see her during the day, since they knew I didn’t agree with what they did. They eventually gave in and I was able to speak with her.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>apo</em>. I didn’t know you were in town,” Lola said to me as I entered her room.</p>

<p>She looked worse than I imagined, as if all the light and life in her had been drained. She had lost a lot of weight and her skin looked like it was just barely hanging onto her bones. Her eyes were sunken and had dark circles around them. It was clear to me then that my family didn’t care what kind of state she was in, just that she was alive.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Sorry it took me so long to come see you, Lola. Um, how are you doing?” I asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen better days.“</p>

<p>“Do you know… what they did?”</p>

<p>She frowned slightly. “Yes. I asked them not to. How did you know about this?”</p>

<p>“I saw you last night. I was trying to, uh… expel the chick from your body.”</p>

<p>She turned to look outside the window. There was a long pause before she responded. “I love my children. I know they had good intentions in the beginning. But they need to let me go. My time on this earth should have ended a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do to help?”</p>

<p>“Kill me.“</p>

<p>Her request stunned me. It took me a moment to think of an appropriate response. “Wha—“</p>

<p>“Do the expelling ritual. Let that fucking chick die in the sun and leave my body to die along with it. Nobody should have access to that kind of magic. I shouldn’t have kept it with me. Screw tradition and trying to appease my ancestors — get rid of the damned thing.”</p>

<p>I was surprised to hear my grandmother use this kind of language. I think she was just… so done with everything at this point. Although, it’s understandable, given everything my family has put her through.</p>

<p>“And don’t tell those entitled brats about your plan!” Lola continued.</p>

<p>“Okay, I’ll do it. I have everything I need for the ritual,” I replied, determined to help my grandmother end this nightmare of a curse.</p>

<p>I headed back to my bedroom to see if Myra had returned at some point to stash the materials in there. Luckily for me, she did. It was all in a black duffel bag, practically begging to be used. I stuffed it in my empty suitcase that had one of those combination locks.</p>

<p>I was getting hungry, so I decided to go to the kitchen to fix something up. Myra was there, grabbing a drink from the fridge. I still didn’t want to talk to her, so I tried sneaking away. Food can wait.</p>

<p>“Louis?” I heard her call after me.</p>

<p>“Oh. Myra, hey. Didn’t see you there,” I said as I turned back around to look at her.</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes at me. “Honey, lying was never your strong suit. Anyway, we need to talk.”</p>

<p>“About the wedding? Yeah, there’s this cake that I—“</p>

<p>“Can you stop trying to avoid the subject, please?”</p>

<p>I sighed. “Babe, I get it, okay? You understand where my family is coming from, which I personally think is stupid, so there’s nothing to talk about. Let’s just agree to disagree.”</p>

<p>“I do get where they’re coming from, but it doesn’t mean I agree with what they did. What they did to your grandmother and to you, your siblings, your cousins — it wasn’t right. I just wanted to give them some time to process the fact that they’re going to lose their mother for good now.”</p>

<p>“Does that mean you’re still going through with the ritual?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in a few days.”</p>

<p>“Things have changed now. I spoke to Lola.”</p>

<p>I told Myra about my grandmother’s request and my plan to execute it. She didn’t like the idea of being a part of actually <em>killing</em> somebody, but she agreed to help, although she wasn’t exactly enthusiastic about it. To be fair, neither was I.</p>

<p>We waited for midnight for Lola to come out, as usual, and started towards the clearing near the balete tree. My heart was pounding in my chest, threatening to jump out of my rib cage, as we waited for her to take the bait.</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure if this was going to go well, since we didn’t have anyone else with us. I was tempted to just go back home to the city and forget this all happened. But I couldn’t let innocent people die. I had a responsibility to this town now, and it was weighing me down like a sack of bricks.</p>

<p>We spotted Lola around a half hour later, her large wings creating a breeze above us. I threw the salt-garlic mixture at her and down she went, just like last time.</p>

<p>Myra and I tried to tie her up, but it proved to be more difficult this time around. My grandmother struggled against Myra’s grasp, shrieking as she thrashed around.</p>

<p>“Ow!” Myra yelled. Lola had bitten her arm and blood started to gush out. I let go of the rope in a panic and Lola took this opportunity to grab a handful of my hair.</p>

<p>“LEAVE. ME. ALONE!” The creature howled in a fiendish voice.</p>

<p>I searched around in my pocket for the salt-garlic mixture with my free hand. Fortunately, I still had a bit left. “Shut the fuck up, freak! You literally asked for this, so just—“, I threw the mixture at her face and continued, &quot;—calm DOWN!”</p>

<p>Lola let out the most horrific scream as she went down once more. I got on top of her to pin her down as Myra tied her up. We hoisted her up the tree while she yelled in protest.</p>

<p>“Are you okay?” I asked Myra as I grabbed the first aid kit from my backpack.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it just… stings a little,” Myra said and let out a dry chuckle. She always tried to seem tougher than she actually was. I applied pressure to the wound with a piece of gauze to stop the bleeding and disinfected it with some antiseptic.</p>

<p>“Is this like, a normal wound? Or are mushrooms gonna start popping out of your arm now?” I asked, trying to lighten the mood a little.</p>

<p>“Nah, it’s gonna be fine. The only real threat is a potential infection, but you already made sure that wouldn’t happen,” she smiled warmly at me.</p>

<p>Damn, I only just then realized how much I missed her. I know, I was the one who was avoiding her but in my defense, I was caught up in the whole <em>manananggal</em> business. I forgot what normal lives we used to lead before all this.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t the time to reminisce, we needed to end this once and for all. I grabbed the concoction from the duffel bag and walked towards the creature hanging from the tree.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry this happened to you, Lola. You deserved so much better,” I said to her.</p>

<p>I spilled the concoction into her already opened mouth. She tried to spit it out at first, but you know that thing you do to dogs to make them swallow a pill? I don’t really know how else to describe it, but that’s what I did.</p>

<p>My grandmother snarled at me as I forced her to swallow the magical drink that would inevitably be the death of her. She started throwing around profanities in Filipino, but I decided to ignore her.</p>

<p>She eventually vomited out the chick and it fell to the ground. I kicked it away from her in case she tried anything. It was a disgusting little thing, covered in bile and mucus. It looked like a regular chick, except it had black feathers and red eyes.</p>

<p>Now we wait.</p>

<p>I started to get sleepy at around 4AM, but I needed to wait this thing out. Kinda hard to do when you’re exhausted from trying to tie a monster up to a tree.</p>

<p>“I brought some snacks in my bag if you’re hungry,” Myra said as she handed me a piece of bread wrapped in a paper towel.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank god,” I practically yanked the thing out of her hand and devoured it in one bite.</p>

<p>“You should get some rest. I can stand watch until sunrise.”</p>

<p>“Maybe for a few minutes…”</p>

<p>I don’t know what happened after that. I may have passed out. By the time I woke up, Myra was gone, and so was the chick. I could only see what remained of the upper-half of Lola’s body. It had been around an hour since sunrise, give or take, so it was mostly just ash.</p>

<p>I ran to the house to check on the lower-half, hoping to run into Myra at some point. It was in the same state as the upper-half by the time I arrived. Everyone was still asleep, so I had a few minutes to try to think of what to say to them when they would inevitably discover what I had done. I decided to search for Myra in the meantime.</p>

<p>I looked just about everywhere, but I couldn’t find her. Maybe the chick dried up before the body did? Since it was smaller? But that wouldn’t explain why Myra had gone missing.</p>

<p>I eventually gave up and headed back home to get some sleep. I think my family got the gist of what happened. The lower-half of the <em>manananggal</em> was gone and there were no traces of ashes. As per usual, they decided to sweep it under the rug. Or a trash can. Ha, jokes.</p>

<p>My mother glared at me as I walked by her in the living room, but I was honestly too tired to care. I just wanted to sleep and look for Myra once I had gotten enough rest.</p>

<p>I woke up at around 3AM and decided to continue my search. As you might remember, Myra often went out at odd times in the middle of the night. I wandered the streets and ended up in a dark alley. I had hoped to find her somewhere, doing her ghost hunting thing.</p>

<p>What I found, instead, was the lower-half of a <a href="https://teddit.net/r/TheGirlwithNoSleep/">human body</a>.</p>

She says I <em>astonish</em> her. That’s quite the compliment. But I vastly prefer the arguments of just a month ago when she’d yell at me about how cold I’ve become, and I’d rifle back by calling her a bitch. </p>

<p>This is a brief story, but I suppose I should back up. </p>

<p>I filed for divorce on July 4th, 2022. Independence Day. Ha. </p>

<p>It wasn’t a long time coming. I thought I’d stay with that woman till death did us part. We had only been fighting regularly for the last five years. </p>

<p>My wife, my love, Nadia. The neurotic neurologist with a face of deep wrinkles forged from stress and cigarettes. Just 40 years old last year. But unfortunately for her 40 is not the new 30. </p>

<p>Brain surgeons aren’t looking any younger. </p>

<p>The truth will come out anyway if I’m telling an accurate account of this horror so I might as well get ahead of it. </p>

<p>I’m vain. Perhaps a better word is shallow. Beauty to me has always been skin deep and the moral of the ugly duckling was that he wasn’t ugly forever. Thank god.</p>

<p>Nadia. Nadia was fucking gorgeous. But please note the tense. </p>

<p>Around her 35th birthday I began to blanch when I woke up next to her in the morning. How can just ten years eclipse a face so pretty? I know Nadia went harder on herself than most. Eighteen-hour surgeries concluding with no heartbeat. All that work just to be berated by the family. </p>

<p><em>Couldn’t you have done more?</em></p>

<p>I get it. I’m sympathetic to her stress. She’s by far and away the bread winner but that doesn’t mean I was ready to be married to someone who looked so old so soon.  </p>

<p>I didn’t <em>not</em> love her, but I just knew I could do so much better. And with so much life left to live! </p>

<p>I’m only 36 years old. I was still a handsome young man with the world at my fingertips. I could easily date a girl who’s 30 and get another ten-year head start on Father Time.  </p>

<p>Besides I thought, Nadia will be fine. She’s brilliant and ambitious. We don’t have any kids to worry about. A divorce was far from the end of the world. </p>

<p>It <em>happens</em>. </p>

<p>I can see what you think. I know it’s pathetic to only be wed till wrinkles do us part. But it was done. She was served on that 4th of July, after our friends went home, sulphur smoke still hanging under the streetlights. </p>

<p>She asked why and I should’ve lied. </p>

<p>But I told her how her beauty had run off, leaving me waking next to a face I didn’t care to recognize.  </p>

<p>She didn’t even look at me. She just stared at the grass and cried. </p>

<p>It was hard on me, too. I felt awful.</p>

<p>Truly.</p>

<p>But we were adults, we didn’t yell or scream. This would end amicably.</p>

<p>Okay it wasn’t that simple. I wanted some of her money.  </p>

<p>But just enough to live on. I wasn’t going to bleed her dry. She had plenty of the stuff and hardly ever spent it. </p>

<p>The next week I was living in the basement while the lawyers worked it all out. Nadia had been too furious to even speak with me. When I told her that I wasn’t going to rent a place yet but move downstairs instead, she didn’t nod or acknowledge me, she just walked away. </p>

<p>One night when I was watching TV, she had snuck up behind me. It wasn’t intentional, our home was one of those suburban monstrosity’s with thick carpets that swallowed sound.</p>

<p>“Richard.” </p>

<p>I jumped and spilled my chips and salsa all down my shirt.</p>

<p>“Nadia, what the fuck,” I said with my mouth full. “I’m watching Knight Rider.”</p>

<p>“We should talk,” she held up a fifth of whiskey and wiggled it. “About us.”</p>

<p>My eyes bulged like a child’s when I saw the bottle. It was a fucking Yamazaki 1999. A $2000 bottle of whiskey that Nadia had once chastised me for buying myself.</p>

<p>“Sure, babe.” </p>

<p>“I’m not your babe.” </p>

<p>“Right.” I didn’t care. I was salivating already. Eyes on the that beautiful, amber bottle. </p>

<p>After just one glass things got hazy. But I wasn’t worried, Nadia wasn’t the poisoning type. She was far smarter than that, but before we’d even dented the bottled the world went black.</p>

<p>____ </p>

<p>I woke in some kind of coma. I couldn’t feel… anything. I couldn’t hear anything. But there wasn’t even my relentless tinnitus ring, cumulated from a youth of Korn concerts. </p>

<p>There was nothing. Nothing for every sense. No smell. No sight. No taste. </p>

<p>I couldn’t even feel my tongue. </p>

<p><em>Is this the purgatory that coma patients feel?</em> </p>

<p>I began to panic but was even more disturbed when I couldn’t feel my heartbeat. There was no surge of adrenaline in my gut. </p>

<p>I couldn’t scream. I pictured myself strapped to a bed in the guest room, Nadia smiling over me as she propped my head under a pillow. Getting the last laugh after all. But this was wrong. Nadia’s worst nightmare would be taking care of an incontinent Richard. </p>

<p>My worry faded as I could suddenly see. Pinpoints of light appeared in the distance. It looked like the night sky, but the darkness in the space between the stars was absolute, a galactic black. </p>

<p>The little lights grew, and the dark was erased. The pinpoints, I realized, were pixels. </p>

<p>I was looking at a gigantic screen. A cursor blinked in a text box. </p>

<p>“…Hello Richard. It’s your ancient looking wife. If you can hear me, look down.”</p>

<p>I looked down and realized then that I couldn’t blink. I couldn’t close my eyes. I began looking around the screen frantically when more words flashed across the screen. </p>

<p>“I’m sorry, you can’t close them. But don’t worry, I’ve got you on a cycle of eye drops. You should know I was an inch away from taking your eyes… but I have something you need to see.” </p>

<p>I desperately wanted to hear my heart thump in my chest, to not just think fear but to feel it in my body. But I was paralyzed. The signals I sent to my arms and legs went unanswered. </p>

<p>A video player appeared on the screen. She clicked the pizza slice of a play button. </p>

<p>It was our wedding video. Bits of it playing in a montage. </p>

<p>There I was. Handsome in a brown suit. And Nadia was <em>beautiful</em>. Her cheeks youthful, burning with blush. </p>

<p>We kissed. </p>

<p>Fed each other cake. </p>

<p>My eyes got wetter and the video stopped. </p>

<p>“There’s one more I want to show you now. It’s a time-lapse,” she typed. “One photo every four hours under 24-hour light.”</p>

<p>She pulled up a new tab. </p>

<p>Hit play. </p>

<p><em>Oh god</em>. I tried to scream but I was more than speechless. </p>

<p>In the video, outside under a flood light, my severed head sat on a mound of mud. </p>

<p>I couldn’t believe what I saw. It was me. My head. But I was clearly dead. </p>

<p>Where my eyes should’ve been in my head were twin black holes and my dead mouth sagged in a sad clown smile. </p>

<p>The frame switched, another four hours passed, and my skin peeled a little from my skull.</p>

<p>It was too high quality to be some kind of deep fake.</p>

<p>It was too <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>The frames continued to flash. </p>

<p>Bugs and worms crawled out of the earth and into my eye sockets. My cheeks began to bloat and then blacken with swarms of flies. A few seconds later the flesh burst to reveal balls of maggots swarming beneath the skin. </p>

<p><em>My</em> skin. </p>

<p>But it can’t be. I’m watching a video. I can see the fucking buffer bar. There are no video players in hell. </p>

<p>Right? </p>

<p>The decomposition continued. </p>

<p>The maggots hatched into flies that abandoned my head as most of the skin on the skull had rotted away and the time-lapse stopped.</p>

<p>The video played normally, and Nadia’s feet appeared on camera. She squatted so she was in frame. </p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>She waved. </p>

<p>She snapped on a pair of purple latex gloves, then picked up my head and took off the top of my skull as if it were some kind of Halloween decoration. </p>

<p><em>This can’t be. This can’t be.</em> </p>

<p>She tilted the skull towards the camera. </p>

<p>My head was hollow. My skull brainless. </p>

<p>Nadia smiled and the video vanished. </p>

<p>The cursor was back, blinking for several seconds on the screen before words began to appear. </p>

<p>“Isn’t that funny? You thought <em>I</em> was getting old. Look at you, Richard. Time has already taken you back to the earth.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t dead, I realized. But I couldn’t understand how I was experiencing reality after watching the video. </p>

<p>Did she clone me? </p>

<p>Make some kind of model of my head? </p>

<p>The typing continued. </p>

<p>“I haven’t enabled it yet, but you will be able to type using your eyes, kinda like Stephen Hawking.”</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment. </p>

<p>“That was a stupid thing to write. Please know you are <em>nothing</em> like Stephen Hawking. </p>

<p>Second thing is you’ll have access to the internet. You’re very special now, Richard, I’d like to keep you entertained. I’d like to keep you alive.</p>

<p>But as incredible as you are… your appearance is disgusting. It’s pathetic. You look like something beached waiting to be picked apart by gulls.”</p>

<p>I knew then what she’d done to me and I wish I could say my heart stopped.  </p>

<p>“I’ll paint you a picture. Your brain sits in a 50-gallon tank with your spinal cord fish-boning out behind you. Your eyes are set above the fluid, still connected to you brain. But they’re inside tubes that look out only to the screen you see now. </p>

<p>Without eyelids they have a constant look of cartoonish surprise. </p>

<p>They make me laugh. </p>

<p>Your heart is artificial. It’s a metal box that pumps oxygenated blood through your brain at 60 beats per minute. I can reach out and pat it,” the typing paused. “Just like that.</p>

<p>I’ve always wondered if this procedure was possible.</p>

<p>It turns out <em>You</em> are an astonishment. A work of scientific genius you never had a chance of being with a body. <em>You</em> cost every dollar I ever saved. </p>

<p>And <em>you</em>. I think you could win the Nobel Prize in physiology. </p>

<p>Even without a face I can still see you in there, Richard. And I really do think you’re still beautiful like this. </p>

<p>I would’ve loved you as you grew wrinkly and old. I loved you, naively, for who you were. </p>

<p>Why couldn’t you have thought the same of me?”</p>

<p>The typing stopped. She wanted me to think about that. And I have been for some time now, because she hasn’t typed anything since. </p>

<p>It’s been 24 days now and I roam the internet with my eyes. </p>

<p>Every day is an existential crisis. Every day I try to find an identity. Take away our faces, our skin and our scars and we’re all the same plain, grey matter.</p>

<p>I was never a handsome young man with the world at my fingertips. I lived inside one. I’m a lonely mind in a black vat of liquid.</p>

<p>How horrifying to realize that this is what I always was. That even when I had a body and a face to admire in the mirror I was just as I am now. </p>

<p>Nothing but a brain in a <a href="https://teddit.net/r/thespookyplace/">box</a>.</p>

This is the story of the following week that led us to where we are now. </p>

<p>It was Saturday when we finally made the big move. </p>

<p>Having had a late start to the day, as the movers had a previous appointment to ours, it took longer than expected. We didn&#39;t end up at our new house until five in the afternoon. </p>

<p>Our house is surrounded by woods and the sun had started to dip below the treeline, casting our house into the shadows of the late afternoon light, in the hours just before twilight. </p>

<p>It&#39;s your basic country home, two stories with a basement, very square, six rooms, two bathrooms, a little porch, and set back in the woods on a road far from town. </p>

<p>Owing to its age, the basement has hot air vents that blow directly into the first floor, but no direct connection to the second floor.</p>

<p>There are grates set into the floor of the second floor rooms, about ten by ten inches across through which the air comes in from the floors below. </p>

<p>While bringing a box up to the master bedroom, I noticed you could see straight through them to the floor below you. I could hear footsteps from the movers in the living room. </p>

<p>I dropped off the box I was carrying and headed back downstairs. </p>

<p>Arriving in the kitchen, I noticed the movers were already back outside getting the next box. </p>

<p>I headed to the front door, and as I opened it the movers were just heading back in with new boxes.  </p>

<p>They must really be hustling to have just been in the living room, and already be coming back with more boxes! </p>

<p>I headed out to the truck to grab another box. I really just wanted to get everything unloaded so we could have time for dinner and a shower before bed. </p>

<p>Audrey was standing in the yard where the sidewalk met the driveway, directing the movers on where all the boxes and furniture went. I shot her a smile and a pompous flex of my muscles before grabbing another box, to which she laughed. </p>

<p>&quot;Where&#39;s this one go, hun?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Second bedroom!&quot; She shouted back, and I headed into the house, up the stairs, and into the second bedroom. </p>

<p>As I entered, one of the movers finished dropping off a box and headed out the door past me and down the stairs. </p>

<p>I dropped off my box and passed by another floor grate. I could hear the mover stomping down the stairs, then his footsteps echoed up through the grate as he seemed to be walking towards the back of the house. </p>

<p>I thought that was a bit weird, and headed downstairs, turned right toward the spare room where I heard him heading, but no one was there. </p>

<p>I assumed there must be something weird in the way sound echoes through the house. </p>

<p>After another forty minutes, the truck was empty, and the movers left. </p>

<p>Audrey and I stood outside in the dying light of the sun and admired our new home. Mentally and physically exhausted, we weren&#39;t overjoyed to go back inside and face the mess that awaited us. </p>

<p>We threw some frozen dinners in the microwave, sat down on the plastic-wrapped couch and ate in quiet contentment, just happy to finally be done. </p>

<p>&quot;Can you believe it? We finally have our own home.&quot; I smiled at her. </p>

<p>&quot;It still doesn&#39;t seem real, like the realtor is going to walk through the door and tell us the mortgage company made a mistake and is cancelling our loan.&quot; She replied. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they won&#39;t find the mistake, I made sure it was very well hidden!&quot; I joked.</p>

<p>She smiled and poked at the last of her mac and cheese. </p>

<p>&quot;We really should get the bed set up before we&#39;re both too tired.&quot; I told her. </p>

<p>&quot;Right!&quot; She agreed, and we tossed our dinner platters in the trash and headed upstairs. </p>

<p>I pulled out all the pieces of the bed and we started lining them up where they would go, then got all the screws ready. </p>

<p>Audrey grabbed the drill from the next room and I started screwing the pieces back together while she held them in place for me. </p>

<p>As I was lining up a screw on the left side, it slipped out of my fingers and bounced along the floor, falling through the grate. </p>

<p>&quot;Son of a bitch.&quot; I swore softly. </p>

<p>&quot;Did you see where it went?&quot; Audrey asked me. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it fell in the vent. It should be in the living room, hold on, I&#39;ll go grab it.&quot; I groaned as I stood, then headed downstairs and into the living room. </p>

<p>I looked around on the floor just below the vent, but the screw was nowhere in sight. </p>

<p>Looking up at the grate, I wondered if the screw hadn&#39;t fallen all the way through, but had landed on something inside the vent?</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, hun, come back up, we have extras!&quot; I heard Audrey yell from the stairs. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just me but I get weirdly annoyed when I can&#39;t find something I&#39;m looking for, even if I don&#39;t need it. It bothered me that I couldn&#39;t find the screw on a bare, hardwood floor. There were only boxes around the perimeter of the room, it had nowhere to go. </p>

<p>I sighed and headed back up to finish making the bed. </p>

<p>Once we finished, we showered and were more excited to get cozy in bed and sleep than I&#39;ve ever felt before. </p>

<p>I got my pajamas on and walked over to the bed then groaned. </p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Audrey asked. </p>

<p>&quot;I left the light on downstairs.&quot; I could see the light from the living room through the vent in the floor. </p>

<p>Begrudgingly, I headed downstairs and into the living room, only to find a completely dark room. </p>

<p>&quot;What the heck…&quot; I whispered.</p>

<p>I looked up through the vent and could see the light of the bedroom through it. </p>

<p>I walked around the house, checking all the rooms downstairs, but all the lights were out. </p>

<p>I wondered if I was just seeing things because I was so tired. </p>

<p>With lingering uncertainty, I headed back upstairs to the bedroom. </p>

<p>I must have looked confused because Audrey asked, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, nothing, I must have been mistaken, because the lights are all off downstairs.&quot; I looked at the vent, and it was completely dark now. </p>

<p>I crawled into bed and fell asleep with little effort. </p>

<p>The next three days passed by uneventfully. Our new home was amazing, and we were very happy, albeit exhausted as we opened boxes, unpacked, sorted through our belongings, moved furniture around, installed appliances, and all the other troubles that come with moving into a new house. </p>

<p>The third night, Audrey woke me up with a hand on my shoulder. </p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; I asked in a groggy voice. </p>

<p>&quot;I think I heard something or someone moving around downstairs.&quot; She replied, her voice a shaking whisper. </p>

<p>I sat up and listened quietly. </p>

<p>There was silence.</p>

<p>And then, a sound like swishing clothes came up from the vent, like someone walking around quietly. </p>

<p>&quot;Fuck…&quot; I hissed. </p>

<p>I wondered if maybe the former homeowner got drunk and came home to the wrong place.</p>

<p>I grabbed the extra shower curtain rod from the closet and headed toward the bedroom door. </p>

<p>&quot;Should we call the cops?&quot; Audrey asked. </p>

<p>I raised one finger to my lips, opened the door and tip-toed out onto the stairs. </p>

<p>It was pitch black all the way down. If anyone was down there, they would have to have a flashlight, unless they&#39;re seriously rigged up with night vision. </p>

<p>I grabbed the hand railing, as I still wasn&#39;t used to the stairs, and started slowly walking down as quietly as I could, but the old steps groaned with each footfall. </p>

<p>My heart started beating faster in my chest, and I could feel a cold sweat on my neck as I descended into the blackness of the first floor, completely blind. </p>

<p>I reached the landing and turned right into the spare room. </p>

<p>I could switch on the light to look, but then I&#39;m also vulnerable to being seen. </p>

<p>What should I do?</p>

<p>I stopped and listened quietly, trying not to breathe. </p>

<p>There was no sound other than the thunder of blood pulsing in my ears. </p>

<p>I reached my hand out into the darkness of the room and flipped the light switch. </p>

<p>In the room was nothing but boxes, so many that they covered all the windows. </p>

<p>I stepped inside and turned to face the door, the curtain rod in front of me, and started walking towards the darkness of the hall, still listening intently. </p>

<p>As I walked into the hallway I flipped the light switch, and continued toward the kitchen. </p>

<p>Room ahead held a slight natural glow from the moonlight outside, and I could see the blue luminescence of the windows. </p>

<p>I kept expecting to see a shadow pass in front of one as I slowly stepped down the hall. </p>

<p>Reaching the kitchen, I flipped on that light, then turned left toward the living room, and walked forward. </p>

<p>&quot;Is someone here? The cops are on their way. You&#39;re making a big mistake. I… I have a gun!&quot; I shouted. </p>

<p>I stood just before the doorway from the kitchen into the livingroom and peered into the darkness. The room ran far to the left of the light radiating in from the kitchen, and I wouldn&#39;t be able to see all of it without sticking my head in and turning on the light. </p>

<p>&quot;Announce yourself, or I&#39;m shooting when I come in there!&quot; I yelled into the living room, then waited, listening in silence. </p>

<p>Nothing…</p>

<p>I stepped into the doorway, my heart racing, I was waiting to be attacked, shot, stabbed. My body braced in expectation of sudden pain.</p>

<p>My hand reached out into the darkness and found the light switch, then flipped it on.</p>

<p>The living room was aglow, and empty, save for boxes, some tables and the couch. </p>

<p>I proceeded to walk the whole room, checking every corner and behind the boxes. </p>

<p>Only the basement was left…</p>

<p>I headed to the top of the basement and stood outside the door. </p>

<p>Looking at the curtain rod, I realized I had a better option, then walked back into the living room and threw it on the couch, grabbing the fire poker from next to the fireplace before heading back to the basement door. </p>

<p>Throwing the door open, I shouted, &quot;If you&#39;re down there, it&#39;s ass whooping time!&quot; </p>

<p>I knew I sounded like an idiot. I am incapable of sounding threatening, but it was more for me than them. </p>

<p>There was no light switch at the top of the stairs, and the stairs that descended into the basement were open in the back. </p>

<p>I took a deep breath, steadied myself, and stepped down onto the first step. The wood shifted and creaked beneath my foot. </p>

<p>And another step, followed by a third. </p>

<p>With each step, I waited, expecting to feel a cold hand wrap around my bare ankle and pull, sending me tumbling down the stairs. </p>

<p>But no hand came. </p>

<p>I took another step, and another, until I reached the string for the lightbulb and pulled. </p>

<p>The warm, yellow light from the single bulb dimly lit the square room. The washer and dryer sat in the corner beside the oil tanks, and the hatchway was still locked. </p>

<p>There was no one. </p>

<p>I headed back upstairs, leaving the basement light on, and locking the door behind me.</p>

<p>I checked the locks on the front and back door, and both were secure, then all the windows, which were also locked before heading back up to the bedroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing there.&quot; I sighed, and sat on the side of the bed, placing the fire poker against the dresser. </p>

<p>&quot;Nothing? But you heard it, right?&quot; She asked me. </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe it&#39;s just the house. It&#39;s new, we don&#39;t know what kinds of noises it makes.&quot; I reasoned. </p>

<p>&quot;But it sounded so much like a person walking, you could hear their clothes moving!&quot; She argued.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, I heard it too, but I promise, there&#39;s nothing. Do you want to go look with me?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;No…&quot; she replied. </p>

<p>I got up and locked the bedroom door. </p>

<p>&quot;Better?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;A little. Maybe we should get an alarm or something?&quot; She suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;We can look into it, but I think we&#39;re okay, let&#39;s get some sleep.&quot; </p>

<p>It took me a long time to calm down and fall asleep, but I was very happy to see the morning light. </p>

<p>Audrey left to run some errands and I decided to do a little investigation while she was gone to assuage my own fears. </p>

<p>I grabbed the fire poker and headed to the attic door. I knew there wasn&#39;t, reasonably, a way in and out of the attic from downstairs, so the &quot;person hiding in the walls&quot; thing was highly unlikely, but it didn&#39;t hurt to check. </p>

<p>Standing under the attic, I pulled on the string, lowering the stairs. </p>

<p>I looked up at the hatchway above me and took a deep breath, my flashlight in one hand, fire poker in the other. </p>

<p>I was ready. </p>

<p>I stepped on the ladder and used the fire poker to push the door open, then started climbing, using my flashlight hand for balance while holding the fire poker at the ready.</p>

<p>I poked my head up into the attic and shone the flashlight in. </p>

<p>The beam was caught in a heavy cloud of dust, but lit up the long, dark attic. </p>

<p>At both ends, a little light filtered in through the vents, but not enough to reveal all the corners of the shadowed room. </p>

<p>I scanned the walls with the flashlight, sweeping from left to right, until I finally had to commit to coming fully into the attic to check the opposite side of the room which the hatch blinded me to. </p>

<p>I stepped up into the attic and quickly turned, flashing the light across the opposite end of the attic, but saw nothing.</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief, confirming there was nothing there. </p>

<p>I left the attic, closing the hatch and headed down the ladder, then pushed it back into the ceiling.</p>

<p>That night I headed up into the bedroom to find Audrey in a state of undress, lying in bed, looking very inviting. </p>

<p>&quot;We haven&#39;t broken in the new house yet.&quot; She said in a lascivious tone.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re right, we haven&#39;t. Would you like to?&quot; I replied with innuendo. </p>

<p>&quot;I would love to.&quot; She beckoned me over. </p>

<p>I walked towards the bed slowly, performing an awkward, faux-sensual dance as I got closer. She laughed at my silly attempt to be sexy. </p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s no neighbors to hear us scream!&quot; I joked. </p>

<p>&quot;No there isn&#39;t!&quot; She smiled and crawled to the edge of the bed on her knees. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what compelled me, but I looked down at the vent as I walked by and froze. </p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Audrey asked. She must have seen it on my face, because I felt like it had drained of blood. </p>

<p>I grabbed the fire poker and ran to the stairs. </p>

<p>&quot;WHAT DID YOU SEE? IS SOMEONE HERE?&quot; She screamed after me, but I was already thundering down into the living room. </p>

<p>I turned on lights as I went until I ran into the living room, the fire poker out in front of me like a rapier, &quot;WHERE ARE YOU? WHEN I FIND YOU I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU!&quot; I screamed into the empty room, spinning around. </p>

<p>It was either get mad, or be crippled by fear, and I chose anger. </p>

<p>But there was nothing here to release that anger on. </p>

<p>&quot;Hun, are you okay?&quot; I heard Audrey calling from the stairs. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;m okay.&quot; I yelled back up</p>

<p>I thought, that&#39;s weird, I should hear her from the vent…</p>

<p>I looked up at the vent, the light in the bedroom was off. </p>

<p>But I was just there, the light was definitely on, and there&#39;s no reason Audrey would have turned them off. </p>

<p>I headed back to the stairs and looked up to see Audrey standing at the top, looking terrified, the light from the bedroom to her back. </p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s something wrong with this house, babe.&quot; I called up to her. </p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; She asked, I could tell she was on the verge of tears. </p>

<p>&quot;I saw someone through the vent. There was someone in the living room standing right under the vent. But then, they were just gone. And from downstairs, the light in the bedroom is off.&quot; I explained.</p>

<p>&quot;W-what does that even mean?&quot; She stammered, tears on her cheeks. </p>

<p>&quot;I… I don&#39;t know.&quot; I replied. </p>

<p>I stormed up into the bedroom and ripped open the drawer to the dresser and started putting on clothes. </p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Audrey asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Get dressed, we&#39;re going to stay in a hotel until I can figure this out.&quot; I told her. </p>

<p>&quot;We can&#39;t afford to just run away to a hotel!&quot; She argued through tears. </p>

<p>&quot;Just for a night or two, I need to get away from this and think, please. I promise we will come back, but I just need time.&quot; </p>

<p>She went to her dresser and got some clothes, and we headed down to the car, and left with nothing but our phones and wallets, and found a hotel to stay in that night. </p>

<p>The next day, we decided to come home during the daytime and check on the house. </p>

<p>For some reason, I expected to find the house in disarray, as if some stranger had gone through and destroyed everything, but it was exactly as we left it, all the lights still on. </p>

<p>Slowly I headed upstairs into the bedroom. </p>

<p>&quot;I need you to do something. Go down into the living room, stand under the vent, and call me.&quot; I told her. </p>

<p>Audrey walked downstairs, and a few seconds later, my phone rang. </p>

<p>I picked it up and put it to my ear. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay, now just look up at the vent and wait a minute.&quot; I instructed her, then slowly lowered a shoelace through the holes in the vent until it came through the other side. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you see the shoelace?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;What shoelace?&quot; She asked. </p>

<p>Something inside me was breaking, I didn&#39;t know what it was, &quot;Can you walk around and see if there&#39;s any other vents in the ceiling, one with a shoelace hanging through it? It should be at least eight inches down.&quot; I explained calmly as I could. </p>

<p>She began walking, I could hear her breathing heavily into the phone as she walked around downstairs looking. </p>

<p>&quot;No, no other vents in the living room.&quot; She told me. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure? I haven&#39;t seen you through the vent. You should be right under me. Am I confused, is this leading to another room?&quot; I asked. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think so…&quot; she replied, walking into the kitchen, then the spare room. </p>

<p>&quot;Is there a room we don&#39;t know about?&quot; I asked her. </p>

<p>&quot;Where? The wall between rooms is barely a foot thick, there&#39;s no place to hide a whole-ass room!&quot; She answered. </p>

<p>&quot;Well how else do you explain that I&#39;m looking straight down through the vent and I haven&#39;t seen you, but I&#39;ve seen other people!&quot; I yelled, more angrily than I intended. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know!&quot; She was sobbing now. </p>

<p>I should have been comforting her, but I couldn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t have the emotional fortitude right now. </p>

<p>I walked into the second bedroom and grabbed the electric drill off the dresser, then came back to the master. </p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Audrey asked on the phone. </p>

<p>&quot;I need to try something. I&#39;m hanging up.&quot; I ended the call, put the phone in my pocket and put the drill to the first screw on the metal grate, and backed it out. </p>

<p>Then the next screw. </p>

<p>A third, and finally the last. </p>

<p>I lifted the grate off the floor, revealing the second one that was attached to the ceiling below.</p>

<p>I lowered my face to the hole to look closer. </p>

<p>As my face got closer, I could see the hardwood floor in the room below, and a single screw sitting in the middle of it. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t get to the screws on the other side from here…</p>

<p>I needed to see more …</p>

<p>I grabbed the fire poker and started slamming it into the grate until it ripped out of the ceiling and plummeted onto the floor below with a loud crash. </p>

<p>&quot;Audrey!&quot; I shouted into the hole, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Is that you hun?&quot; I heard her yell from the doorway behind me. </p>

<p>&quot;Go into the living room and yell!&quot; I called out to her. </p>

<p>I heard her footsteps heading into the living room, but I couldn&#39;t see her below me. </p>

<p>She started to yell, &quot;CAN YOU HEAR ME?!&quot; </p>

<p>I could hear her voice from the doorway behind me, but not from the hole in the floor.</p>

<p>I grabbed my phone, and switched it to video, then slowly lowered it down into the room below me, and rotated it in a circle while recording, then lifted it back up. </p>

<p>I flipped it over and hit play, and watched as the phone circled on a room that looked mostly like our living room, but I couldn&#39;t see much as I had just lowered it an inch or two past the hole. </p>

<p>I took a deep breath, and sank down into the hole up to my shoulder, hit record, and began rotating the phone back and forth inside the hole. </p>

<p>I sat back up, but as I did, my phone caught on the edge of the ceiling and fell from my shaking hand to the floor below. </p>

<p>&quot;FUCK!&quot; I screamed. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Audrey called up the stairs. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, can you come here?&quot; I called out to her. </p>

<p>Audrey&#39;s footsteps ascended the stairs behind me. </p>

<p>&quot;I need your phone, I accidentally dropped mine.&quot; I explained.</p>

<p>She approached slowly, seeing me next to the open hole in the floor seemed to fill her with dread. </p>

<p>&quot;I was just down there, if you had dropped it … if you had opened the vent … I should have seen…&quot; she whimpered. </p>

<p>&quot;Please, can I just see your phone?&quot; I repeated my request. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like this. I don&#39;t like this. Maybe we shouldn&#39;t…&quot; she stammered. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s fine, I just need to see your phone.&quot; I repeated.  </p>

<p>&quot;We should just cover it up, just put a big board over it and forget all about it. We can put in a new vent.&quot; She argued. </p>

<p>&quot;Audrey, please, I just want to see your phone, so I can see if this is some kind of hidden room.&quot; I explained. </p>

<p>&quot;Look! It has fucking daylight! It has windows! If it was hidden we would have seen it from outside! It&#39;s not a fucking hidden room! This isn&#39;t right! We shouldn&#39;t be fucking around with it!&quot; Her face was red with tears now. </p>

<p>&quot;Audrey, please I just …&quot; I stopped when I heard it.</p>

<p>She heard it too.</p>

<p>Footsteps. </p>

<p>Coming from the vent. </p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s someone there.&quot; Audrey whispered through tears. </p>

<p>&quot;Shh.&quot; I hushed her shortly. </p>

<p>The footsteps continued to grow louder. </p>

<p>&quot;We should close it.&quot; She whispered. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah…&quot; I agreed, and grabbed the grate, and started lining up the screw holes. The footsteps were slow, but growing louder.</p>

<p>&quot;Shit, where did I put them…&quot; I looked around the floor, stood and checked on the nearby dressers and tables. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s getting closer!&quot; She yelled. </p>

<p>&quot;I know, I have to find the fucking screws!&quot; I shouted. </p>

<p>Then I patted my pocket and felt the outline of a few small objects, then stuck my hand inside to find the screws. </p>

<p>I grabbed the drill, lined up the first hole and started drilling the screw in. </p>

<p>&quot;Holy shit holy shit holy shit.&quot; I repeated, lining up the second hole, I placed the screw in the hole, but it was crooked. I placed the drill bit tip to the screw, intending to reposition it with the magnetic tip, but instead I accidentally slapped it back into the vent hole.</p>

<p>&quot;FUCK!&quot; I screamed, grabbing another screw, I lined it up carefully, shaking and sweating, and drilled it in. It was crooked, and cross-threaded but it sank. </p>

<p>I grabbed the third screw and dropped it in a hole and sunk it into the floor, then stood and backed away from the vent. </p>

<p>We both stood on the landing of the stairs and watched the vent. The footsteps continued until they stopped just below the vent, and I could hear breathing from below. </p>

<p>&quot;What do we do?&quot; Audrey whispered into my ear. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. I wanted so bad to see who it was before… but now it&#39;s there I&#39;m terrified.&quot; I answered. </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe they&#39;re friendly?&quot; She suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, maybe…&quot; I blew air out my nose at the joke. </p>

<p>BANG, something slammed against the grate, and it popped up at the corner missing the screw before slapping back down.</p>

<p>BANG. </p>

<p>I ran into the room and slid the dresser over the grate, then walked back to the staircase landing with Audrey. </p>

<p>The banging against the grate continued for several minutes, then calmed. </p>

<p>We stood, watching and listening, our hearts thundering. </p>

<p>Then a soft noise came from below the dresser, a crying noise, but not one that sounded normal.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t sound human. </p>

<p>Nor like any animal I had ever heard. </p>

<p>It was bizarre, the way it hauntingly reverberated in the empty living room below. </p>

<p>I walked over to the dresser and put my hands on it. </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Audrey hissed. </p>

<p>I looked up at her, I was scared too, but I had to know more. </p>

<p>I pushed the dresser, then looked down. </p>

<p>The floor grate was bent out of shape and no longer sat flush to the floor, and the two outer screws had mostly ripped free of their holes. </p>

<p>I looked through the holes in the grate, but there was nothing directly below me. </p>

<p>I started to circle the hole, trying to see further into the room when I caught a glimpse of something in the corner. </p>

<p>It looked like a pile of dirty white rags, but it was heaving. </p>

<p>Pulsating.</p>

<p>Breathing. </p>

<p>I stepped back and slid the dresser back into place. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know how to fix it, or close whatever this hole was, but I didn&#39;t have a choice, we just spent all of our savings moving into this house. </p>

<p>We had nowhere to go. </p>

<p>I knew I needed to find a way…</p>

<p>&quot;Should we call the cops?&quot; Audrey asked. </p>

<p>&quot;And tell them what? There&#39;s a hole in our bedroom that leads to a room that doesn&#39;t fucking exist? Oh yeah, and there&#39;s a THING in there trying to get out.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Please, stop yelling at me.&quot; She cried. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I just feel like I have to have the answers and I don&#39;t know what to say!&quot; I replied. </p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just scared and don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; She sobbed. </p>

<p>&quot;Me either.&quot; I put my arm around her and rubbed her back. </p>

<p>We returned to the hotel for another night we couldn&#39;t really afford. I stayed up on my phone googling everything I could about portals, and doorways to other worlds, but it was all bullshit mysticism and folk stories. </p>

<p>There were no stories or instructions on closing holes in your floors leading to places that shouldn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>&quot;What if we burn it?&quot; I suggested. </p>

<p>&quot;Burn our house down?&quot; Audrey asked. </p>

<p>&quot;Well it&#39;s not really our house, is it? If we light the other house on fire and cover the hole, maybe that will do something?&quot; I replied. </p>

<p>&quot;It might be able to burn ours too, we don&#39;t really know.&quot; She cautioned. </p>

<p>&quot;True, but at this point, I&#39;m wondering if burning the whole thing down isn&#39;t the best answer. It&#39;ll be hard to accuse us of insurance fraud if the evidence of how the fire started is all in another dimension or something.&quot; I explained.</p>

<p>&quot;True, but I think the fact we&#39;ve only lived here less than a week is going to raise a red flag.&quot; Audrey postulated.</p>

<p>I covered my face with my hands, completely unable to come up with a solution, and began crying. </p>

<p>We had finally made it, our house, our own place, after all these years, only to have it stolen from us by some unexplainable phenomenon.</p>

<p>What kind of sick joke was this universe playing? </p>

<p>Anyway, this has been my story.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t afford another night at the hotel, so tomorrow I&#39;m going to Lowe&#39;s, and I&#39;m going to get a bunch of wood, cement and tools and try to patch up that hole. Hopefully I will seal away whatever is on the other side.</p>

But I find it to be true in a different way than the standard comprehension of the saying. Love makes you turn a blind eye to a myriad of faults, misdeeds and red flags is how I’ve come to understand it. </p>

<p>I’ve been interviewed at least a dozen times now, and the number one question is always, <em>how could you love such a monster?</em> </p>

<p>But I didn’t really know the answer… I’m both disgusted and quite frankly shocked that even still, when I lay awake at night in my bed, I miss her. My heart aches for her touch while my stomach churns with revulsion.  </p>

<p><em>How can I love a monster?</em></p>

<p>It all started with a smile. One of those smiles that reached all the way up to the eyes, pure joy in the sparkle of those baby blues. </p>

<p>You’d think after all those years of detective work, I’d be able to spot a killer when I saw one. That I’d be able to smell the rot brewing beneath layers of Chanel. But… love is blind. And I was hooked from the very beginning. An addict. </p>

<p>The smile led to conversation, which led to drinks and then to the best sex I’d ever had. I could still feel the brush of her lips on my neck. The thought sent a shiver down my spine. </p>

<p>She had been so normal or had seemed to be in the beginning anyway. Sure, she was a little odd, but I had assumed all artists were. The quirky weirdness was required to make good artwork or something like that. If only I had known…</p>

<p>The department had put me on unpaid leave until this P.R. nightmare was over with. I’d turned in my badge and gun to the chief when the press had gotten a hold of her identity. A homicide detective who had been unknowingly dating the Mannequin Killer for months. What a damn mess…  </p>

<p>I hadn’t been the lead detective on the case thank God, but I had been a consult for it. And how did that make me look? Well, it made it look like I was tipping her off. Keeping her ahead of the police. But that wasn’t the case… unfortunately very few people believed that I was innocent. </p>

<p>Thankfully, one man did though, my old partner who did happen to be the lead on the case. He knew I would never disgrace the shield like that. He also knew I wouldn’t take this one lying down either, badge or no badge, because underneath all of that love and disgust was rage. White hot unbridled rage from being fooled so easily. For the humiliation of the press and the tarnishment of an otherwise immaculate career. For all the warm nights I spent with a cold-blooded killer. For being tricked into loving a… <em>monster.</em></p>

<p>I slammed the manilla folders that Rodriguez had copied for me on my desk. I took a deep breath and opened the first one. </p>

<p>“<em>Jesus…”</em> I whispered. </p>

<p>The crime scene photos always got me, no matter how many times I looked through them. And I always made myself study them for a moment before moving on to the other files. It was a punishment. My penance for being so close to the killer and not knowing it. </p>

<p>Joseph M. Reynolds and Claire S. Adams, a young couple, newly engaged. The picture showed them both staged at a dinner table in their apartment. His hand was hoisted with a wire coming from the ceiling, giving a toast to his dead fiancée. Her hands were nailed to her chest, a twisted smile cut into her face from ear to ear. Almost as if she were laughing at something Mr. Reynolds had said. Spoiled pasta with molded butter sauce sat on the table along with a candle that had burned down to the end of its wick. </p>

<p>Another picture showed the Mayfield’s at a family picnic in front of their barn. The mother and father were propped up with two by fours through the back of the shirt. The lumber had been buried four feet down so that they would remain in place, sitting cross-legged at the edge of the blanket. This one especially made my stomach churn because of the boy and his dog. </p>

<p>The son, Eric, lay on his side with an arm around the poisoned golden retriever. It seems she tried to capture a wild-eyed gleam on the boy’s face and to do so needed to remove his eyelids. </p>

<p>There was a dozen more photos just like these, depicting the murders that had occurred over the past year and a half. I thumbed through them even as bile rose in my throat. I had to. I owed it to the victims… </p>

<p>She was an artist, dubbed the Mannequin Killer due to setting up the bodies like… well you guessed it, mannequins. The name was fitting, although I hated it for obvious reasons. It seemed she was trying to capture a still life scene with the bodies. To freeze them in a moment forever.</p>

<p>She’d gotten interrupted during her last murder a month ago and had to flee the scene. Her work was unfinished, and she hadn’t cleaned up after herself yet. Normally the entire crime scene had been painstakingly wiped with bleach, no evidence whatsoever. This time we had fingerprints and a hair follicle. Rodriguez barely had time to break the news to me before it was all over the tv. </p>

<p>Now I was a social pariah. My name was hardly cleared despite being very open to the public with information on our relationship. </p>

<p>I slid open my desk drawer and grabbed the bottle of Jameson that rattled against the oak. I didn’t bother with a glass anymore and took a healthy swig. It burned on the way down just like I needed it to, scratching that itch for comfort. </p>

<p>She had no family. She’d grown up in an orphanage. That I did know, she’d told me the story of what it was like to grow up in the system over dinner at Mel’s Diner one night. I could remember her getting choked up over it as she explained the loneliness of her childhood. I had wiped her tears and made her laugh. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was genuine or not. Were the emotions real? Or was she playing me the entire time? Nothing made sense to me anymore… </p>

<p>The rest of the documents detailed everything the department knew about Evelyn Carter. I poured over the words diligently, digesting every sentence like I had every night for the last three weeks. </p>

<p>Detective Rodriguez had exhausted every lead from the file, as had I. Names and numbers of acquaintances, friends and customers were crossed out with a red pen. I’d spoken to them all, no one knew where she was hiding. </p>

<p><em>Unless…</em></p>

<p>I kept coming back to the ledger from the auction house where she had sold her paintings. I’d put a large question mark and circled it at the top of the document. There was about twenty or so sales credited to her, but I know she’d taken almost double that in the time I’d known her to auction and if they hadn’t of sold, they would have been stashed in her apartment or at her storage locker. But there were only a couple of works in progress found at her residence and none in storage. Something just didn’t add up… </p>

<p>The desk clock beeped as the hour rolled to 11:00pm. I think it was time to pay her art broker another visit and drag him out of bed. </p>

<p>I stood and holstered my .38 special in a shoulder rig before throwing on my jacket, then slammed the front door to my apartment before traveling out into the night. </p>

<p>----- </p>

<p>Flakes of snow fell lazily on the asphalt as I parked in front of Francis Maynard’s swanky house at the end of a cul-de-sac. It was the rich part of town and my old 72’ El Camino stood out like a sore thumb. Luckily the entire neighborhood of mini mansions was asleep and silent. </p>

<p>I killed the big block engine and exited the car. A motion detector light triggered at my presence, illuminating the walkway to the house. I passed through the barrier of rose bushes and loudly beat my fist on the front door. </p>

<p>A bedroom light flipped on upstairs. I walked out to the front yard and saw Francis peeping out from behind the blinds. I motioned for him to come downstairs, the expression on my face said, <em>or else…</em></p>

<p>After a moment there was a sound of the deadbolt sliding and then the door opened just a few inches. </p>

<p>“Detective… it is very late.” He hissed. </p>

<p>“Sorry to bother you so late Mr. Maynard. I couldn’t sleep and was going over the files and well… something just wasn’t adding up. I wanted to go over some things with you if you have a few minutes?” I smiled, trying to seem genuine. </p>

<p>“Detective it’s the middle of the night. I was trying to sleep and have a very big event in the morning that I must be rested for. Can this wait?” He asked, tapping his foot in frustration.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid it can’t. But it won’t take long.” </p>

<p>His mouth opened in protest, but I didn’t let him continue before pressing my hand against the door and prying it open. His mouth was agape in surprise as I pushed my way inside to the foyer. </p>

<p>“What a lovely home you have Mr. Maynard.” I said as I admired the eloquent marbling of the floor and the crown molding that ran along the staircase. The ceilings were incredibly high, and the stained-glass windows were roughly the size of my car.</p>

<p>“Sure, sure… just come on in.” He huffed under his breath while closing the front door. </p>

<p>“Again, sorry to wake you, Francis. Can I call you Francis?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maynard is fine…” He grumbled.</p>

<p>“Sure. So, as I was saying Francis, I just need to go over a couple of the details with you about your business relationship with Ms. Carter.” I traced my finger over the face of a cherub carved from stone that sat on a shelf by the hallway. </p>

<p>“I’ve told you and Detective Rodriguez everything already. It’s in my statement, you could have just reread it and saved yourself a trip across town in the middle of the night.” </p>

<p>“Yeah, you see, I’ve actually read your statement at least a hundred times, including the sales ledger you provided us, and you know… they just seemed a little light on the details.” </p>

<p>“What do you mean?” He furrowed his brow. </p>

<p>“Well, I mean… she sold a ton of paintings. And I mean, a ton. She spent countless hours prepping them for you. I know because she would complain about how much of a pain in the ass you were if they weren’t packaged correctly.” </p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are implying.” He frowned. </p>

<p>“Well see, some of the titles I did recognize from the ledger, but I knew there were some she took to you that I didn’t see. I’m thinking perhaps, you have a buyer that enjoyed her work and just maybe didn’t want to be on the books? Perhaps he put a little extra coin in your pocket to keep it under the table?” I asked, slowly pacing a circle around Mr. Maynard. </p>

<p>“I see. I can assure you I’ve given the police department the complete list. I have nothing to hide, and I don’t appreciate the accusations.” </p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean to accuse, Francis, unless my questions are stirring a guilty conscience?” </p>

<p>“The only thing I’m guilty of is working with that evil woman… but at least I never slept with her.” </p>

<p>It was a low blow, and it certainly struck a nerve. </p>

<p>His grin quickly faded from his face after I reared back and slapped the taste out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“YOU, YOU CAN’T… YOU CAN’T TOUCH ME!” He cried. </p>

<p>I smacked him again. Francis held his face in shock. </p>

<p>“Now listen to me, those were at fifty percent. The next time I hit you it’s going to be at a hundred, you understand?” I growled. </p>

<p>“But… but you’re a cop you can’t…” He whimpered. </p>

<p>“Interesting thing Mr. Maynard. I’ve been put on unpaid leave indefinitely. My career is most likely over. I’ve got nothing to lose.” I snarled at him with a crazed look in my eye. </p>

<p>And he looked afraid… like a rabbit pinned down by a coyote.</p>

<p>“So, what’s it gonna be Francis? More pain? Or give up your buyer?” </p>

<p>I could tell he was thinking, his eyes darted back and forth nervously. He opened his mouth but closed it again, he was running through his options in his head. </p>

<p>But as I brought my arm up again, he quickly made the right decision.</p>

<p>“Okay, okay!” He shrieked. </p>

<p>Francis walked into the kitchen that gleamed in chrome and corian. I followed him to a drink cart where he poured himself a glass of scotch with shaky hands. He chugged the entire glass before speaking again. </p>

<p>“Norman Black. He’s a wealthy investor, lives upstate in a cabin out in the middle of nowhere.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve been there?” I asked, scribbling details on a notepad from my pocket. </p>

<p>“Once… for a private auction he hosted.” Mr. Maynard rubbed his temples, a large handprint growing more and more prevalent on his cheek. </p>

<p>“What’s the address?” </p>

<p>Francis rifled through a rolodex on the counter and then handed me a sleek black card. </p>

<p><em>Norman Black</em></p>

<p><em>Collector</em></p>

<p>On the back was an address in Long Point, Michigan. </p>

<p>“Does Mr. Black have a phone number?”</p>

<p>“If he does, I don’t have it.” </p>

<p>“Well thank you Francis, you’ve been most helpful.” I beamed at him, sliding the card in my pocket. He smiled back weakly and showed me to the door. </p>

<p>I paused just before exiting the threshold and said, “Oh and we don’t need to let the boys down at the station know about this little visit, do we?”</p>

<p>“N-no sir.” He stuttered. </p>

<p>“Good. Then I won’t let them know you were hiding evidence either. Have a good night Mr. Maynard.” </p>

<p>I heard the door softly shut behind me as I made my way back to the car. For the first time in days, I was hopeful. Was she hiding out at Norman Black’s cabin? And if not, did he know where she might be? I wasn’t sure, but it was something to go on. Finally, a fresh lead. Maybe I could actually get some sleep tonight for once.</p>

<p>---- </p>

<p>LED lights buzzed overhead, flickering slightly. </p>

<p><em>Oh my God, what is that smell?</em></p>

<p>A putrid stench molested my nostrils, like an old slaughterhouse rotting in the Texas sun.</p>

<p>I tried to move but couldn’t. My limbs were impossibly stiff. The only thing I could move at all were my eyes. </p>

<p>I rolled them from left to right, right to left. It was hard to get my bearings at first because only a few light panels were illuminated, but I could see I was at the police station… Rows of desks with stacks of paperwork led into the darkness. </p>

<p><em>How am I here?</em></p>

<p>A shadowy figure loomed near the coffee machine at the edge of the light. </p>

<p><em>Is that… Rodriguez?</em> </p>

<p>I blinked the blur away from my vision and he suddenly came into focus. </p>

<p><em>Mary, mother of God.</em> </p>

<p>He was held up by steel wires tied to the ceiling grid like a puppet. The coffee pot was glued to one hand and a mug in the other. </p>

<p>But his face… his face looked like it had been removed and then pulled back and stapled on. His eyes were squinted, and his lips were stretched upward almost in laughter. The staples gleamed under the fluorescents as blood trickled down his neck in a stream. </p>

<p>My heart thundered in my chest. I desperately wanted to reach for my gun. </p>

<p><em>Why can’t I move?</em></p>

<p>I could see Sergeant Hobbs sitting at her desk. Her face was even worse than Rodriguez. Her eyelids had been removed and her smile was so jagged, as if it had been carved with a box cutter. Hobbs was enjoying the silent joke they shared as her eyes bulged so impossibly that they threatened to burst from the sockets. </p>

<p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump</em></p>

<p>It sounded as if someone was running on the beams above. Suddenly, an acoustical pad fell to the floor from the ceiling. </p>

<p>A series of clicks came from the hole, like an insect rubbing their mandibles together. </p>

<p>Long auburn hair slipped through the opening, followed by a face hidden in the fray. </p>

<p>“Do you like it?” She whispered. </p>

<p>I tried to answer but couldn’t move my mouth. </p>

<p>“I thought you would.” </p>

<p>The voice was deeper, but so familiar. </p>

<p><em>Evie?</em></p>

<p>“Don’t you like it, Michael?” </p>

<p>Her words reverberated around my skull like an echo. They were so quiet and warm, yet so dark and foreboding. </p>

<p>“Look at your screen Michael.” Her voice grew louder, she was excited. </p>

<p>I moved my eyes to look at the computer monitor. It was powered off and I could see myself clearly in the black mirror. </p>

<p>Deep lacerations revealed my cheek bones through the flesh. My eyelids were gone, and my eyebrows were peeled upward. </p>

<p>A silent scream erupted from my chest. I started to choke on saliva, unable to swallow. Spit bubbled through the cuts in my face as my windpipe flooded and threatened to close. </p>

<p>As I struggled, I could see her lower herself through the ceiling. Her body was that of an enormous spider, black and glossy. The light refracted through a translucent red hourglass on her abdomen. </p>

<p>“Now you can stay here with me, just like this, forever. We can be happy together.”</p>

<p>Dozens of beady eyes stared into mine as viscous fluid dripped from her fangs. They danced hungrily as she came closer. </p>

<p>“Don’t you like it, Michael?”</p>

<p><em>NOOOOOOOOO!</em></p>

<p>I sat upright in the bed panting. Sweat poured down my chest and soaked the sheets. </p>

<p><em>A dream… just a dream.</em></p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Despite the nightmare I felt like a million bucks. It was the first real sleep I’d gotten in a month. I had stopped and picked up an F-150 from the car rental place down by the airport. It was a five-hour drive and the El Camino got about 10 miles to the gallon on a good day. Plus, Evelyn knew that car. If I had any real shot of sneaking up on her and taking her in, it wouldn’t be in the Camino. </p>

<p>For the next several hours I drove past snow covered pastures and prairies as Johnny Cash hummed over the speakers. I let my mind drift to thoughts of her. I could see her on the balcony, mixing paints to get the perfect shades of blue for her rendition of the smoky mountains on canvas. Her smile when she noticed that I was watching her. The way she dropped her palette and strolled over to me. Hips swinging suggestively as she began to strip in the sunlight that leaked through the windows. </p>

<p>But then images of the crime scenes overtook the memory. Bodies posed using wood, wire, and mesh. Emotions carved into their flesh like they were a lump of clay in the hands of the potter. The buzzing of bloated flies and the sickly-sweet smell of meat as I paced around the scene looking for evidence. How I’d come home to her the night that I’d seen the boy wrapped around his dead dog. How I’d wept and how she had comforted me. </p>

<p><em>Sick fuck…</em> I thought, squeezing the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles were white. </p>

<p>---- </p>

<p>3:03PM. </p>

<p>I pulled around a sharp bend in the road and parked the truck off to the side of a gravel drive, one that led straight to Norman Black’s cabin. The cabin was large and luxurious, just like I’d imaged it would be. It sat about two hundred yards off from the road and was shrouded in blue spruce trees. </p>

<p>I did a quick pat check, .45 pistol in the shoulder rig, revolver on the ankle, keys, knife, and phone in pocket. Then made my way around the perimeter of the property, making sure to stay concealed in the pines. </p>

<p>The good news was I didn’t see a security detail. I wasn’t sure what to expect exactly, I couldn’t find much information on the guy other than that he ran a few non-profits and hosted several art galleries around the country. I’m sure I could have dug up more if I still had access to the database down at the station, but it had been revoked and I didn’t want to bring Rodriguez in on the situation. Not yet. Not until I had something concrete. </p>

<p>I observed the cabin for about forty minutes before I saw Norman Black. He walked into the living area that was surrounded with large bay windows and flipped open a laptop that sat on the table. He was a tall and slender man, probably mid-fifties with salt and pepper hair. Well-groomed with a youthful appearance for his age. </p>

<p>Once I was sure he was alone I decided it was time for us to meet. </p>

<p>---- </p>

<p>I rapped my knuckles against the emerald door and it opened almost immediately.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Black?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, how can I help you?” He responded pleasantly. </p>

<p>“Hi, I’m Detective Hart with the Dayton Police Department. Do you have a few minutes?” </p>

<p>“Oh, what’s this about?” His charming smile faltered just a little. </p>

<p>“Well, it’s a private matter pertaining to one of the artists that you frequently buy from and we’re just trying to collect some information on her whereabouts. Perhaps we could go inside to discuss?” I prayed he wouldn’t ask to see my badge.</p>

<p>“Of course, come on in.” He extended his arm, warmly inviting me inside his rustic palace. </p>

<p>I followed him to the living room where I’d seen him earlier. There were so many windows you felt as if you were outside among the trees. </p>

<p>“Would you like a drink detective?” </p>

<p>“Sure, that would be great. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“My pleasure. I have water, coffee or perhaps a glass of bourbon?” </p>

<p>“Bourbon would be perfect.” I hadn’t had a drink all day, causing my hands to tremble ever so slightly.</p>

<p>He gestured for me to sit in a leather chair adjacent from the couch as he left to pour our drinks. A large chandelier made of antlers hovered a few feet above. Paintings lined the back wall that led to the kitchen. </p>

<p>“So, who is this artist you are looking for?” He asked, handing me a whiskey glass. </p>

<p>“Evelyn Carter. She’s been all over the news for weeks as I’m sure you’ve seen.” I took a long pull of bourbon, the warmth of it was intoxicating. </p>

<p>“Ah yes… such atrocities.” </p>

<p>“Agreed. Absolute abominations… But you were a fan of her work, correct? Before she was named as the Mannequin Killer.” I finished my drink and felt a little more like myself. </p>

<p>“I believe I might have a few paintings from her, yes. Such talent… although I had no idea she was capable of such things. I’d never even met the woman in person.” </p>

<p>“Right. You had Francis Maynard broker the sales, correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. And I see that paying him extra to keep my name off the books didn’t really pay off.” He sighed. </p>

<p>“Mr. Maynard hid your name very well actually, but I can be pretty persuasive.” I stood and wandered over to the windows. There was a perfect view of the lake over the tops of the pines. I could see steps that led from the side of the cabin all the way down to a yellow boathouse on the shore.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have no doubt about that Michael.” Norman chuckled from the couch. </p>

<p>Someone was coming up from the boathouse. I could see a white sun hat floating above dainty shoulders in a sundress. </p>

<p>“Did I… did I tell you my first name?” I grabbed onto the chair rail, suddenly the room started to spin. </p>

<p>“In fact, I was actually scared shitless all the way up until I got you that drink.” </p>

<p>“Wha-what was in the dr-drink?” My lips were numb, and my tongue was swollen. I slipped down to my knees. </p>

<p>I looked at Norman Black, he was smiling with a mouthful of ultra-white teeth. Then I looked back to the window, it was her. She stood from the ground, looking up at me and waving. </p>

<p><em>Evie…</em> </p>

<p>I felt my head smack the hardwood floors as everything went black. </p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>When I awoke my head felt as if it might split in two. My vision swam for a moment before the cabin’s basement came into view. I quickly realized the gravity of the situation when I found myself roped to a chair. </p>

<p>I tried to yell but a handkerchief was tied through my mouth and around the back of my head. I thrashed against my restraints, but it was no use. </p>

<p>“Easy Michael, easy. It’s okay. Oh, I missed you so much.” Evelyn squeezed my neck and kissed my forehead and cheek, before finally sticking her tongue in my ear. </p>

<p>“<em>Get away from me!”</em> I screamed. But my words were incomprehensible through the bandana. </p>

<p>“Are you ready Evelyn?” Mr. Black called from the corner as he dimmed the lights. </p>

<p>I twisted and shook once more, desperate to be free. </p>

<p>“Shhhh, it’s alright. We’re just going to watch a film. <em>The</em> film. My life’s work. Norman has been funding the entire thing, bless his heart. I hope you like it, Michael.” She caressed my face with her palm and then sat beside me. </p>

<p>She squealed in delight as the projector hummed to life and squeezed my arm. She was completely delusional. A true psychopath. </p>

<p>It was shot completely in black and white, which was a small mercy. The blood that spurt from the tissue she eviscerated didn’t look as horrifying as it would have in color. I could almost pretend that the gore wasn’t real in the monochrome video.</p>

<p>I watched as she set each scene, moving the bodies, propping them up to their appropriate still life actions. Then how she’d cut, skin, scalp and staple each one to give them the proper expression that she desired to capture. </p>

<p>Tears rolled down my cheeks as she cut the eyelids off from the boy as he was still just barely breathing, but unable to resist. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. I owed it to the victims. I could have stopped this. But I didn’t… I didn’t know. </p>

<p>I did now though. I knew exactly what I was dealing with… Pure evil. </p>

<p>I glanced over to Norman, he was loving it. His tongue was practically hanging out of his head with delight over the film. I looked to Evelyn, tears were streaming down her face as well but they weren’t the same as mine. Hers were as if she was watching something beautiful, like the birth of her own child finally coming into the world. </p>

<p>I had to stop this. I had to make sure this could never happen again. </p>

<p>Finally, it was over, followed by a brief roll of credits. Norman Black was highlighted as the benefactor of course. But I was noted as a special thanks at the end. A black and white photo of her and I kissing at the diner appeared on the screen just for a moment before it went black. </p>

<p>“Evelyn that was… INCREDIBLE.” Norman stood and clapped, giving her a standing ovation. </p>

<p>She jumped to her feet and took several bows and giggled with delight. </p>

<p>“I’m so glad you liked it! I knew you would… did you like it Michael?” She beamed at me. </p>

<p>I smiled the best I could and rolled my eyes down dramatically at the gag in my mouth. </p>

<p>“Oh, yes, let me get that for you hun.” She pulled the bandana out from my mouth and let it dangle from my neck. </p>

<p>I took a deep breath and cracked my jaw. I knew I had to be convincing if this was going to work. </p>

<p>“That was magnificent Evie. A true work of art.” I swallowed back vomit as I lied. </p>

<p>She fell to her knees and crawled towards me, resting her hands on my knees. </p>

<p>“Do you really mean that Michael?” Her eyes welled with tears. </p>

<p>“Of course, I do. Anyone with eyes could see the beauty you’ve captured here. The way you brought the dead back to life. No one else could have done this, that’s for sure.” I meant that part. </p>

<p>“It… it means the world to me that you loved it. I just knew deep down inside that you could appreciate it once you saw it. Once I revealed it to you, I knew you would love it.” Her lips quivered as she brought her face down into my lap, sobbing with absolute joy. </p>

<p>“Of course, he loved it Evelyn, God himself couldn’t have done better.” Norman sung her praises and made his way over to me. </p>

<p>“You’ve got yourself a real revolutionary here Michael. You are a luck man.” He said, patting me on the back. </p>

<p>“I am incredibly lucky, that’s for sure.” I choked, struggling to stay in character. </p>

<p>Evelyn rose her head and kissed me deeply, never closing her blue eyes. I had an overwhelming urge to bite her nose and rip it from her face, but I stifled it. </p>

<p>“I love you Michael. Thank you.” </p>

<p>I smiled back at her but couldn’t bring myself to say those three little words. </p>

<p>She stood and gave Norman a hug. They shouted in joyous harmony while dancing in a circle like children. </p>

<p>While they were distracted, I nosed at my right ankle with my left shoe. My heart thundered in my chest when I felt the cool touch of the pearl handle of my .38 press against my lower calf. </p>

<p>“Say guys, I’d really love to celebrate as well. How about you untie me, we all go upstairs, and you can fix me a proper drink this time Mr. Black?” I winked and gave them both my best grin.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, let’s!” She squeaked with joy, giving a little twirl in her sundress. </p>

<p>“Of course. No hard feelings about the restraints right old boy?” Norman asked as he untied the ropes from behind the chair. </p>

<p>“None whatsoever Mr. Black.” </p>

<p>“Come now, we’re all friends here, call me Norman.”</p>

<p>“Okay, Norman.” I stood from the chair and shook his hand, then brought Evelyn into an embrace. She squeezed me tightly and kissed my neck. </p>

<p>It felt cold… the love was completely gone. All that remained was violent disgust and rage. </p>

<p>We crossed the room together to the stairs, I gestured for them to go ahead of me and brought up the rear. About halfway up the steps I stopped and reached down, lifting my pant leg and pulling my gun from its holster. They didn’t notice, they were deep in conversation about the recent success. </p>

<p>“Hey, Evelyn.” I called. </p>

<p>“Yes, Michael.” She turned to face me.</p>

<p>“Go to hell.” I smiled as I pulled the trigger twice. </p>

<p>BANG. BANG. </p>

<p>The look of utter shock and terror on her face was just so… satisfying. </p>

<p>I flatted my body against the staircase wall as she went rolling to the bottom. </p>

<p>Norman held his hands up, he was trying to plead for his life but kept choking on his words. </p>

<p>BANG. </p>

<p>I sent a bullet right through his neck. He grabbed at his throat, gasping for air as blood spewed like a faucet from the wound. </p>

<p>BANG. </p>

<p>His head snapped back as a round ripped through his face, completely disintegrating his nose. Norman Black fell and slid down a few steps before stopping halfway down the stairs. </p>

<p>I finished the ascent and went outside to sit on the front porch. I patted my pockets, my phone was still there. Seemed as they only took the .45 from my shoulder. Not very thorough indeed. </p>

<p>I dialed an old friend. </p>

<p>“Hey, Rodriguez. Tell Michelle you’re not going to be home for dinner tonight… I got her.”</p>

A man’s liable to go over the side if he ain’t careful.”</p>

<p>I ran my hands through my mop of auburn hair. I had sent in an application months before and told the captain I had no experience on the water, but maybe he didn’t see that part. It had worried me at that moment that I may be about to lose the job before I even started.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” I replied. “I have no experience on a boat. I know how to swim and have spent time at the lakes back home, but nothing like this.”</p>

<p>Captain Orange furrowed his brow as he looked me over. It was hard to determine his age. All of his hair had gone gray and his face with lined with deep wrinkles. His body was a stout rack of muscle. He was either in his later years or life on the sea had worn him down.</p>

<p>“My business manager must not have looked over your application too well,” he said dismissively. “Crabbing on the Bering Sea ain’t a game. You young folks watch some damn show on the Discovery Channel and think it’s a quick payday. It ain’t. Not sure this is gonna be for you.”</p>

<p>I grabbed my duffle bag from the wet concrete and turned to walk back to the hotel. My mind raced between the disappointment of rejection and the panic of paying for a plane ticket home. My back account was nearly drained and I would have had to use my already taxed credit card.</p>

<p>“Hang on,” he shouted. “Be here at six in the morning tomorrow. It’s too damn late for me to find a new deckhand and you’re just gonna have to learn to be useful real quick. If you can’t keep up, crab ain’t gonna be the only thing we dump at the port.”</p>

<p>The old man turned and walked back onto the deck of his boat before vanishing into the wheelhouse.</p>

<p><em>F/V Weeping Widow</em> rocked gently against the pier.</p>

<p>________________________</p>

<p>I spent the first two hours of our trip to the Bering Sea violently dumping my breakfast into the filthy toilet just off the kitchen. Every time I retched, I could hear the other deckhands howl with laughter outside. Captain Orange had told the crew to hit their bunks for a bit of rest before we reached the crabbing grounds, but their laughter and jeers made it clear they had no intention of heeding the advice.</p>

<p>It seemed like all of my stomach contents had successfully ejected when pounding began to sound against the thin wooden door.</p>

<p>“Alright, greenhorn!” one of the deckhands shouted. “Time to get off your ass and on your feet! We’ll be dropping pots soon and that herring won’t hop in the bait bag. Let’s move!”</p>

<p>I could hear the sounds of their voices growing quiet and the thuds of heavy boots heading up the steps onto the deck. Wiping my face on my sleeve, I pushed myself onto my feet and walked out the door. The smell of beer and cigarette smoke nearly made my seasick stomach turn again, but I managed to press the urge back down.</p>

<p>Pushing the bulkhead door open, I entered the equipment room where the other hands were slipping into their cold weather gear and waders. A big man who I thought was named Jimmy shoved a bright orange body suit into my hands and smacked me on the shoulder. I looked at it in confusion. It was completely different from the gear the other men were wearing.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” I asked the man. “It doesn’t look like the same gear the rest of you have.”</p>

<p>“That’s an immersion suit, son,” he responded with mild annoyance. “Captain told us you’ve never been out to see before and got no boat experience. Me and all the boys think you’ll fall overboard and this is the only thing likely to save your rookie ass.”</p>

<p>The other men began to howl laughter again. I began to put on the enormous suit, unsure if it was a joke or not. There was no other gear in the room, so my options were limited. The others began to file out of the bulkhead and onto the deck.</p>

<p>After five minutes of struggling into the immersion gear, I was finally ready to join them outside. Cutting wind and water slapped my face as soon as I stepped onto the deck. The other hands scurried from crab pots cinching ropes and checking for holes. Jimmy stood beside an industrial grinder and waved me over.</p>

<p>“Grab these bait bags and we’ll start linin’ ‘em up over at the pot launch,” he said, gesturing to a pile of mesh sacks filled to the brim with ground fish. “Gotta hurry if you wanna keep the job.”</p>

<p>I grabbed as many of the bait bags as I could and began to clumsily waddle toward the launcher at the side of the ship. The immersion suit was unbelievably bulky and made it difficult to bend my legs to walk. My feet slipped and shuffled as I tried to find purchase on the wet deck boards.</p>

<p>I had just finished dropping the first load of bait bags when the boat grew silent. The engines had stopped. There was no more hurried noise from the crew who had been readying the crab pots to launch.</p>

<p>An electric sensation of fear jolted through my body in the sudden silence.</p>

<p>I turned toward the deck to see all seven deckhands surrounding me in a semi-circle. Just as I was about to speak, I heard the door from the wheelhouse open and slam closed. Looking up, Captain Orange stood against the railing, hands clenched around the frigid metal, a grim look on his face.</p>

<p>“It ain’t personal, Lucas,” he shouted. “We’ve got a tradition here on the Weeping Widow. Every four or five years me and the boys sacrifice a man to the sea. Keeps the rest of us safe from harm. Superstitious, maybe, but we ain’t lost a man accidentally in twenty-two years. That suit’ll give you a few hours to get right with whatever god you pray to.”</p>

<p>At first, I thought it was a joke, but a few of the men pulled work knives from their belts as they all walked toward me. Captain Orange had already turned and walked back into the wheelhouse, slamming the door behind him. The engines roared to life and the boat jolted forward.</p>

<p>“Over the side,” Jimmy said. “Or the boys’ll have to stab you a few times to inspire you.”</p>

<p>“Please!” I screamed at the men as they slowly closed in on me. “Don’t do this! Just take me back! I won’t tell anyone!”</p>

<p>They remained silent and continued forward. The first man was in arm’s reach and leaned in to grab me. I swung my fist as hard as I could and made contact with the side of his head. He stumbled back, shocked at the unexpected blow. </p>

<p>As I prepared myself to throw another blow, the others began to move in faster. While I was distracted by the first man, the others seized the opportunity to tackle me to the railing of the shift. I thrashed violently and hit every man within reach, but it was no good.</p>

<p>I felt two of them wrap their arms around my ankles and lift me into the air. My hands clenched around the metal railing and they tipped me over the side. Grip still in place, I slammed against the hull of the ship and looked up in horror. Seven crazed faces stared down at me, smiling with sadistic glee.</p>

<p>One of the men began trying to pry my fingers from the rails, but the sudden surge of adrenaline had increased my strength. No matter how hard he pulled my fingers or slammed his fist down, my grip wouldn’t break. Then I saw one of the men vanish. He returned moments later with a hammer.</p>

<p>Lifting the hammer above his head, he brought it down on my left hand with a sickening crack. White blurs of pain filled my eyes as I heard the sickening crunch. My left hand spasmed in pain and fell from the railing. The weight of my body strained my right arm as I continued to hold on to the rail. My muscles burned with agony as I watched him lift the hammer a second time.</p>

<p>The second wave of pain swept my body as the hammer made contact. My vision went black. The splintered bones of my right hand gave way and I fell to the churning sea below.</p>

<p>_________________________</p>

<p>My loss of consciousness was momentary. I felt as though I slammed against concrete as my body met with the rough waves below. The unimaginable cold encompassed my body almost instantly and any hope of drifting away to a peaceful death vanished.</p>

<p>I began to struggle against the waves and paddled my arms to turn myself upright. Fresh bolts of pain erupted in my hands and shot up my arms as I tried to use them to right myself in the water. The suit had kept me dry, but the bulk made it nearly impossible to control my movements.</p>

<p>Finally, I managed to get myself onto my back and floated on top of the choppy sea. Whitecap waves lapped and slammed against me, filling my mouth with briny water and making it difficult to breathe. As soon as I passed over the top of a new wave, I would coast down the back and dip below the water before coming back up and gasping for air.</p>

<p>I could see the F/V Weeping Widow rocking gently on the waves and the spotlight moved into the distance. A man was standing at the back of the bot, one arm propped on the railing and the other waving merrily in my direction. It looked like he lowered it to blow me a kiss.</p>

<p>“Thank ya, greenhorn!” he shouted with glee. “If my kids knew what ya sacrificed to keep their ole man safe, they’d thank ya too!”</p>

<p>“Please!” I shouted.</p>

<p>I slipped under the water again.</p>

<p>“Come back!”</p>

<p>Another whitecap swells over my head, filling my mouth with salty water.</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me!”</p>

<p>A larger wave pushed me a few feet under, sending water into my lungs.</p>

<p>“I… can’t… please…”</p>

<p>The lights vanished over the rolling waves, leaving me in the pitch dark. The water began to calm a bit as the wake of the boat settled. My balance returned and I began to float calmly in the water.</p>

<p>Stars burned brightly overhead. I had never been this far away from a city to see them so clearly. They would have been beautiful in any other setting.</p>

<p>There in the Bering Sea, the stars would be the only witnesses to my funeral.</p>

<p>_________________________</p>

<p>I drifted for hours. The immersion suit had kept the worst of the cold at bay for a while, but I had eventually started to feel the icy daggers of the frigid water creep into my muscles. I had given up on trying to swim. My body ached and it hurt to move. Hopelessness had overtaken me and I simply waited to die.</p>

<p>After letting go of the fear and anxiety, I noticed I felt a bit better. The water didn’t seem to be as cold now. My body aches were dissipating. I felt almost… comfortable.</p>

<p>Hypothermia. Late stage, probably. It’s no way to go, but by the time the false warmth starts filling your body, you’re almost thankful.</p>

<p>I had decided to close my eyes and rest and let the ocean take me when I heard something in the distance.</p>

<p>A rumbling sound.</p>

<p>A ship’s engine.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes and scanned the area and in the distance, I could see a dim light. There was a ship passing to my right. Too far away to see me. Too far away to hear me scream. I rested my hands on my chest as tears filled my eyes.</p>

<p>My hands rested on top of a hard, found piece of plastic. Confused, I fumbled at it with my bent and broken fingers until I felt a bump on the side. Pushing it in, the night sky filled with obnoxious light.</p>

<p>The damn suit had a strobe. I had been out there for hours and never checked the suit for any gear. There was no telling how many ships might have passed close enough to see it, but in my panic, I never checked.</p>

<p>Bright flashes of light nearly blinded me as they radiated in the night sky. I shielded my eyes with my crippled hand and turned my head toward the boat passing me by. My mind was foggy, but I thought I could see a spotlight burst to life on the deck.</p>

<p>A thin beam of harsh light began to scan the sea all around me. With great effort, I lifted my arms in the air to wave, hoping the reflective tape on the sides of the suit would catch their attention as well. After a few moments, the spotlight fell on me and I had to shield my eyes completely.</p>

<p>The light remained on me for what felt like an eternity until I could hear the deafening roar of the engine of a ship nearby. Waves began to crash violently against me. Once again, I struggled to keep my head above water and breathe.</p>

<p>“This is the United States Coast Guard.” A resonating voice called from the ship’s loudspeaker. “We will dispatch a rescue team to pull you aboard!”</p>

<p>A few moments later I was pulled into an inflatable boat. There were a few men and women on board talking into radios as we sped back to the larger shift. The luminous spotlight followed us the entire way. It was like a light from Heaven, carrying me back to safe harbors.</p>

<p>I started sobbing uncontrollably. A woman sitting next to me grabbed my hand to comfort me. The pain was excruciating, but I didn’t bother telling her about my injuries. I was too relieved to be in the sight of another person that the pain was worth the contact. I squeezed her hand back as best as I could with my shattered fingers.</p>

<p>We pulled alongside the Coast Guard boat and four cables dropped from a crane above. The rescue team started attaching the clasps to the boat and in moments we were lifting from the choppy sea. Tears flowed freely as we drifted upward to the deck.</p>

<p>As we lifted above the side, the crane began to swing us onto the deck before gently lowering the boat. A swarm of warmly dressed men and women pulled me from the boat and put me on a stretcher. They chattered back and forth about care measures as my mind swam in the joy of my rescue.</p>

<p>“Hey there, big guy,” one of the men said. “Can you tell me how you ended up in the drink out there? You’re a long way from land.”</p>

<p>“Thrown overboard,” I said in a croaky voice. “Crabbing boat… <em>Weeping Widow</em>… crew tossed… me overboard.”</p>

<p>The man’s expression changed from professionally friendly to concerned.</p>

<p>“Let me go grab the captain,” he said before vanishing through the rest of the crew.</p>

<p>A few moments later, a woman stood beside the stretcher as the crew pulled me from my wet suit and wrapped me in blankets. The serious woman held a warm cup of coffee to my lips and I drank deeply.</p>

<p>“Sir, can you please tell me what happened on the <em>F/V Weeping Widow</em>?</p>

<p>I told her how the crew had cornered me before throwing me from the boat. She listened intently as I explained to her how I had treaded water for hours and how I had struggled to flag down their passing vessel. She nodded and assured me that I would be safe.</p>

<p>_________________________</p>

<p>Her version of safe differed greatly from mine. I was flown back to the mainland and my hands were treated at a hospital in Anchorage. After my recovery, I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for observation.</p>

<p>The crew of the <em>F/V Weeping Widow</em> all reported to authorities that I had become unstable after going out to sea. After running a string of crab pots, the captain had given the crew a few hours of rack time. While everyone was in their bunk, I must have snuck to the equipment room, put on the immersion suit, and jumped overboard in an elaborate suicide attempt.</p>

<p>None of the crew faced charges and the hospital eventually released me to fly home, broken and destitute. I’ll never be the same, yet the <em>F/V Weeping Widow</em> still sails as it always has.</p>

<p>I used to give tours in the large, sprawling cave that makes up one of the main features of our park, but a week ago, we had an incident occur which led us to close it indefinitely. I was there that night, and I know the reason why.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>I always count the people in my tour group through the tour. Even more frequently on the tour I was giving that day, where it’s a bit more strenuous and goes through the undeveloped portions of the cave. Since it sort of acts as a four-hour introduction to caving – you tend to get the more adventurous sorts. </p>

<p>Most people are respectful, responsible, and careful – but as always, there are some exceptions. You’d think it’d be common sense to not wander off alone in a dark cave, but you’d be surprised. For example, I had one guy yell at me recently when I tried to prevent him from wandering off away from the group. He told me he could handle it, he had been hiking for years and he had a satellite phone so he’d be fine. I decided it wasn’t worth arguing with him about how satellite phones won’t work 200 feet below ground, so I just heavily implied that leaving the tour group would result in a permanent ban from every park in the country. It’s not true, but it kept him safe and with the group.</p>

<p>I was also especially focused because starting that day, the tour route bypassed one of the usual tunnels, which was closed for conservation efforts, and took a detour through an area that hadn’t been on the tour route for years. </p>

<p>Anyways, back to counting the group. We limit this tour to ten people (adults), and we make sure there are no overlapping tours that follow the same route. In addition to making sure we don’t lose anyone, it helps prevent people from either mistakenly or intentionally joining a different tour group than the one they started with – preventing a potentially dangerous and expensive search and rescue operation for a missing person that’s not really missing.</p>

<p>I had a full group, it was the last tour of the day, and it was going really well at first. I had some repeat attendees that I recognized, everyone was careful, paid attention, and asked good questions. The whole group stuck with me at all times. </p>

<p>When we went through the detour section, the smell hit me – earthy, but with an undertone of decay. There was an intersection on that path that forked off far into the darkness, and the smell seemed stronger down there which made me really uncomfortable. I let everyone go ahead of me to stop in the next, more open space, because something about that place gave me a really bad feeling.</p>

<p>I counted the one person who had somehow managed to end up behind me, and then sighed in relief. We had all eleven people... That wasn’t right, I should only have ten... Or maybe it was? I suddenly felt my confusion and concern melt away, so I shrugged and moved onwards.</p>

<p>The rest of the tour went great, until we were almost done and approaching the elevators. We lost power. We had our headlamps so we weren’t in absolute blackness, but it was still jarring to be unexpectedly thrown into darkness in the part of the cave that usually has full lighting.</p>

<p>Luckily, the backup generator came on in under a minute. We have some pretty intense thunderstorms up here, and although this had never happened to me while I was on a tour, it had happened to a couple of fellow rangers.</p>

<p>The issue, though, is that neither elevator seemed to work even after the generator turned on. I pushed the button, but nothing happened. The natural cave entrance is too small for most people to fit through, so the elevators were the only feasible way in and out.</p>

<p>I wasn’t too panicked at that point yet. The elevator area was one of the few areas in the cave where you could actually make and receive phone calls – we have phone line laid there for that very reason.</p>

<p>I made a call to upstairs, I let them know about the issue, and did my best to calm the group down while I told them the plan. Everyone was dressed warmly enough to be able to withstand the 50ish degree weather for awhile longer – we don’t allow food or drinks in the cave, but I was hoping we’d be out before that it became an issue.</p>

<p>It’s funny, I’ve always worried about losing someone, but since we have no overlapping tours, I’d never even given a thought to what I’d do if I ended up with an extra person. So, when there were twelve people when I turned around to do a count again, I was a bit at a loss of what to do. I counted multiple times, and it was more apparent that we had two more people in our group now than we came in with. </p>

<p>“Did you lose your tour group?” I asked broadly, waiting hopefully for two people to speak up and say yes they got separated and joined us, but they all stared at me in silence.</p>

<p>I searched the faces of the people that I’d spent the past four hours with, and there wasn’t anyone that seemed new. Everyone I looked at, I felt like I could remember their name, and walking with them for the past few hours. Maybe I was losing it, I thought at the time. Maybe we’d made an exception?</p>

<p>After a while, I called upstairs for an update, they were going to try and get at least some sort of emergency fix in to get everyone out, they expected it to be at least another hour or so. </p>

<p>I turned around and filled the group in, there was a bit of the chorus of sighs and groans I had been expecting, but there was also something else – a thirteenth person, hovering at the edge of the group.</p>

<p>Before I really had time to even fully process that development, one of my tour members suddenly darted away from the group clustered at the elevators and she ran back into the darkness of the cave.</p>

<p>I dug out my spare elevator key (you have to have a key to operate these, so no one can go up or down without a ranger), handed it to one of my repeat attendees I knew I could trust, and ran after her. I shouted back at the others to stay put and monitor the phone, and to go up without me if needed. </p>

<p>I tried to keep her in my light, but she was so nimble. She ducked, weaved, and navigated like an expert. I struggled to keep up even in the portions of the trail I frequented almost daily. I was seriously worried for her safety – no matter how familiar you are with the area, running through a cave, much less in the dark, is never safe. I wouldn’t have been running myself if I didn’t need to in order to keep up with her.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she was gone, and I realized I was somewhere I hadn’t been before. I was approaching a wall with just a small crevice that opened to the other side. I didn’t see her in it or anywhere else for that matter  – it was as if she had become one with the darkness itself. That was when it first hit me – she had no headlamp. Or helmet, or knee pads. Or shoes. How the hell did I not notice that when I was looking over the group for outliers?!</p>

<p>I looked around frantically, as the fear of her being potentially lost deep within the part of the cave that I was less familiar with, sunk in.</p>

<p>Just as I was debating my next move, I saw her again. She had somehow ended up in between me and the way I had come. She was far enough away from me that she was partially hidden in the shadows. </p>

<p>My relief was short lived though, when I realized for the first time that her eyes reflected in the dim light, a reddish orange hue – like an animal&#39;s – like something that evolved in the dark. Fear turned into dread and I instinctively moved as if to back away as she approached, but after a step back, I was against the wall. I felt for the crevice and tried to slowly walk sideways against the wall so it was behind me. There was nowhere else to go and I hoped I’d fit.</p>

<p>As she emerged further into my light, I noticed features that I somehow hadn’t caught before. Her mouth was too wide, her eyes were small and perfectly round with wide pupils. What I had before interpreted as loose fitting caving clothes, were layers drooping flesh, upon closer scrutiny. What I was looking at was not a person at all… seriously, how had I not noticed before now? Minutes ago I could’ve sworn this was a youngish girl with mousy brown hair – that I’d been walking around with her for hours, known her by name. Her name was… I realized I couldn’t remember.</p>

<p>It lunged at me and I did the best thing I could think of at the time, I shoved myself sideways as far into the crevice as I could go.</p>

<p>It managed to take a decent sized chunk out of my arm, and I squeezed myself in further. Eventually it hissed and faded back into the darkness.</p>

<p>I had a brief moment of reprieve where the panic faded. I carefully focused on trying to squeeze back out, holding my breath, trying to shrink my profile. That’s when I realized, I could distinctly hear something else breathing behind me, on the other side.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I was being pulled backwards by something – it was tearing into my jacket and the arm that was pinned behind me, but the opening was too thin. Eventually, it appeared to give up and the only breathing I could hear was my own.</p>

<p>I tried to take a deep breath and for the first time realized just how tight the rock was around me – I couldn’t even fill my lungs. What I had just encountered was quickly becoming a close runner up, but this was my literal worst nightmare. How long would it be until someone could find me, much less help me? I tried not to focus on thoughts of dying, wedged here in the darkness. Each shallowed, panicked breath just served to remind me of how tightly I was stuck.</p>

<p>I reminded myself that panicking wouldn’t help. I just had to focus on getting out. </p>

<p>It took what felt like an eternity to squeeze back out. By then, whatever was hunting me appeared to be long gone. I had a slew of cuts and abrasions both from the rocks and the creature, but the slick blood from the injuries had at least aided me in sliding out.</p>

<p>It took me longer to walk back, much longer, as I crawled, ducked, and stepped back, stiff, bloody, and exhausted. I was worried about my group. </p>

<p>I was tempted to call out, to let my group know I was on my way, to warn them, But I was hesitant to draw any attention to my location, or possibly have anyone from the group stray from the others to try and find me. Whatever the creature was, it seemed unwilling or unable to attack all of us at once, so I held on to the hope that they stayed together.</p>

<p>As I approached, I heard the sounds eating off in the distance, it was hard to gauge from where but I could hear the aggressive smacking and chewing of someone long hungry. I sighed, I wasn’t looking forward to having that ‘you aren’t supposed to bring food in here’ conversation with a group that was already hungry, tired, and unhappy from having had been stuck in a cave for hours. I decided that as long as they were safe, I’d just deal with the repercussions and clean up without saying a word.</p>

<p>I heard the phone ringing in the distance, it continued to echo, unanswered.</p>

<p>By the time I got to the elevator, they were all gone. I called to them, but got no response. I pressed the button and could hear the elevator moving. I tried to wait to check upstairs before panicking –  they’d probably already gone up.</p>

<p>From the elevator, I took a last look into the darkness as the doors closed. Multiple pairs of red-orange eyes reflected the lights from my headlamp far in the distance. I suddenly panicked at the thought of if they could figure out how to use the elevator – I pictured them hunting our hikers on secluded trails, or through the small town outside of the park … but calmed myself, remembering no, they’d need a key.</p>

<p>As the elevator rose, I tried working out in my mind how the hell I’d explain that we needed to close the trails to my supervisor, without sounding insane.</p>

<p>When I came up the elevator, my coworkers and supervisor were waiting. From the moment the doors opened, they fretted over my injuries and told me they were worried when the tour group came up without me, and were working on sending an Initial Response Team to search for me.</p>

<p>“So the whole group made it out okay?”, I confirmed -- I needed to hear it.</p>

<p>“You did great. Everyone’s safe and accounted for. They were in good shape, so we sent them home awhile ago.”, my supervisor smiled, “All sixteen of them.”</p>

I know I won’t be able to avoid sleep forever, but it’s a good temporary solution until I figure out what to do. Besides, I’ve honestly never felt better. I have a lot more energy than usual, which is counterintuitive, but it works for me. The only downside is I’m extremely sensitive to light and sound, but that’s okay, I’ll live. I feel on top of the world. Only, I swear sometimes I can see shadow figures fleeting out the corners of my eyes. I try to pay them no mind but they’re honestly creeping me out. I pretend I don’t see them. I assume they abide by the same laws as the ‘other me’ and they’re here to watch me. I’m not supposed to know they’re there. So, if I know about them but pretend not to, that gives me a tactical advantage. I’ll figure out how to deal with them, but as long as they’re passive observers, it’s not a priority. Maybe they were always there and I’m only now privy to their existence. That almost puts me at ease because if I was okay before I’ll be okay now. </p>

<p>It feels like the more time I spend awake the more attuned I am to the world around me. I think about something and it happens; I hear little signs in songs on the radio while I’m driving to work. I keep seeing repeating numbers everywhere, which the internet says are significant. I’ve never been much of a believer in the spiritual, but now it seems to make sense. I feel incredibly connected to some kind of higher power, and to the world. Everything feels so alive; I am elated. On my way home from work I decided to pick up some books about spirituality. I bought some on Buddhism, dreams, demons, alternate dimensions, and spiritual enlightenment. I bought 14 books in total. As soon as I got home I started reading. Didn’t even wash my hands or use the bathroom, hadn’t eaten since the day before. But that didn’t feel important. I had a crystal clear focus on the books. </p>

<p>The night came and went, the Sun went up, and I was still reading. I was so engrossed in my studies that I missed work that day. The thing that finally made me look up from my stack of books and get up was the fetid stench of rotten eggs that filled my nostrils. I searched the house trying to find the source but it seemed to come from everywhere. I remembered: I had just read last night about how when a negative presence is situated in your home, you might sense awful smells, and that it’s one of the first indications of something going south spiritually.
I saw many shadows that day. Fleeting past me as I was reading, lurking in dark corners as I walked through my home. I grew agitated. I wanted to scream at them to leave me alone but I had to restrain myself from doing so because they mustn’t know that I know about them. The Sun went down and I looked out of my window onto the quiet neighborhood, street lamps illuminating houses and the road. Something caught my eye. In the distance, in the middle of the street, stood a dark figure. I could only make out a silhouette. My heart thudded against my chest. The sound of static filled my ears. I whipped my head around to see the TV. ‘ESCAPE WHILE YOU CAN’. </p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>The street lights turned off one by one. The air felt heavy, I could barely breathe. There was that sense that everything was wrong again. Shadows closed in around me as I ran out of my house and jumped into the car. I drove to Mark’s apartment and banged on the door. He let me in with a puzzled look on his face. ‘What happened, what’s wrong?’ 
‘I can’t explain it, I just need someone to keep me company tonight.’
‘You look scared, man’, he said.
I didn’t reply. I helped myself to a bottle of wine from his kitchen and we talked about random stuff. He really tried his best to keep my mind off of the situation and didn’t ask more questions about it. I appreciated that. At around 3 AM he went to sleep as he said he was exhausted, and I was alone once again. I managed to get an hour or two of sleep, but it was filled with nightmares. I kept dreaming about that other me chasing me. It said to me: ‘better wake up before you forget how to’. I jumped off the couch covered in sweat.</p>

<p>I got up and thanked Mark for everything, then I drove back home to get ready for work. The whole day at work I was disassociated from reality, lost in thought, in worry and anxiety. Shannon approached me at the water cooler.
‘Have you heard about doppelgangers?’ she asked.
‘No… Look, I’m kind of busy right now and even though I’d love to talk-‘
‘Listen,’ she cut me off, ‘they’re supposed to be these evil doubles of people and it is said that if you meet yours, you’re in for a pretty bad time…’</p>

<p>‘Shannon, that sounds really intriguing. But I really need to get back to work, you know, I’m behind on some e-mails and stuff since I missed work yesterday. I’ll see you around.’
I went back to my cubicle and tried to get to work. I spent most of my day in a daze, not due to a lack of energy, but due to the overall sense of confusion and dread that i felt. I could not stop sweating and my heart was pounding constantly.</p>

<p>When I finally got home, I realized I couldn’t relax there. It felt so foreign. There was an ominous hum and the air felt so heavy. I decided to go to a bar near me and just drink this whole thing away. I couldn’t take it anymore. I drank and cried until I was denied a drink as they saw I was pretty far gone. I had no choice but to go home. I tried reading my books when I to put my mind at ease and maybe find something useful, but the effects of the alcohol took over and I was soon fast asleep. I woke up in pitch darkness with the TV on. </p>

<p>‘THERE IS NO ESCAPE NOW. IT WILL REPLACE YOU.’</p>

<p>Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. What does that mean?!</p>

<p>My heart was palpitating, the adrenaline rush made my stomach twist in knots. I ran to the bathroom to puke. When I looked in the mirror, I could swear my reflection was actually my copy staring back at me. I puked again and passed out in the bathroom. </p>

<p>The next morning I remembered what Shannon said about doppelgangers. I scoured the internet for anything I could find on them, until, on I-don’t-even-know-what page of Google, I saw a link that intrigued me. For some reason, it was already purple, but I paid it no mind. I immediately clicked on it. It was an old simple website that looked like it hadn’t been updated in ages and the title read ‘Doppelganger: Your Secret Twin’. I began reading and my jaw soon hit the floor. The text said that these creatures are basically copies of people that live in an alternate pocket dimension and that if you ever come in contact with yours, it will try to take over your life and replace you. So that’s why it’s been studying me…</p>

<p><em>click</em></p>

<p>My laptop turned off by itself. Then all the light bulbs burst one by one. The smell of sulfur filled my home again. I ran to the car to drive to Mark’s place, street lamps turning off behind me. By the time I came close to his apartment I was crying hysterically. I was speeding, running red lights, I didn’t care. I could barely even see from all the tears collecting in my eyes. I came onto an intersection; another fucking red light. Behind me, in the rear view mirror, I saw the silhouette of that thing again. I sped up and…</p>

<p>Everything went black.</p>

<p>Apparently, I was hit by another car and it was a miracle I came out alive. At least that’s what the paramedics said as they loaded me onto the ambulance. I had a concussion, a cracked rib, and some major bruising, but other than that, I was fine. They asked me a lot of questions but I soon broke down and told them I could not fucking keep it together anymore. I told them about the TV, the shadows, the signs, the doppelganger. I told them everything. I was so scared. Of course, they didn’t believe me. They arranged for me to be transferred from the ER to a psychiatric ward. Fuck. My. Life.</p>

<p>Now, as I sit here waiting for them to take my phone away and admit me, I just realized something. It’ll be so easy for that fucking monster to take over my life now that I’m about to be locked away for god knows how long. And the more I try to explain that to the doctors, the longer they’ll keep me there. I know I’m not crazy. It was all a part of its plan.</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Oh God, please don’t shoot me. I’ve done everything you told me to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;The shooter is just a precaution, to make sure you —&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Have you shot Michael?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;No, I haven’t shot anyone. I want you to —&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Why do you have a van? You said you had a truck?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Rose, calm down. Don’t worry about what I said on the horn, listen to what I’m saying now. I don’t have Michael.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;You don&#39;t … have …&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;No, I don’t have Michael. I just told you I did. I never had a truck neither. It ain’t safe for me to transmit my true situation.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;So … what&#39;s going on? Why are you here?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;All you need to know is that I need a place to lay low for a while.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;But Michael still isn’t back. He won’t know what’s going on if he sees you with a gun, what if —&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;We’ll talk about that soon, Rose. Right now we got work to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Work? What work?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;We need to cover my minivan up with branches so she’s not visible from the track. Now, start moving towards the minivan, Rose.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Okay …&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;I want you to lean a few o’ those branches against the minivan to cover her up. If there ain’t enough on the ground, snap some off from those bushes.&quot;</p>

<p>She started doing as she was told.</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;You aren&#39;t going to help?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;I gotta keep my gun on you, Rose. But, like I said, you do exactly as you’re told and you won’t get hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;And what if Michael comes back? Will he get hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;No, he won’t. When he comes back you’ll tell him Chopper’s in charge. Then you’ll cuff him to make sure he don’t try any heroics.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Handcuff him? With what?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper tapped his trouser pocket with his torch, there was a dull metallic clink.</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;The cuffs in my pocket.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Why do you have handcuffs in the first place?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;They’re another precaution. Precaution is important in my line o’ work, Rose.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;And what exactly is your line of work?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;That ain’t something you need to know. Just keep on covering up the minivan, you’re doing a real good job so far.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;And what if Michael doesn’t come back at all? I told you how worried I am. What if he’s still out there in the dark? What if I need to go out and look for him?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;I&#39;ve already looked for him, Rose.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Keep working. I didn&#39;t say stop.&quot;</p>

<p>She did as she was told.</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;I went looking for Michael after we first spoke. I have a decent map so I knew which way he’d be moving if he was goin’ to Pitwell. There’s only one trail he could take. My plan was to knock him out and toss him in the minivan. Leverage so I could come up here.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Let me guess. When you couldn’t find him, you just decided to lie and tell me you had.&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;That’s right, Rose. But me not bein’ able to find him, it means he must have made it to Pitwell safe. He’s probably hauled up in some bar working out how best to say sorry to you. Ain’t no need to worry.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;And if he comes back you promise you won’t hurt him?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;I don&#39;t wanna hurt no one unless I have to.&quot;</p>

<p>She heaved one last pine branch over the minivan.</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Will that do?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Yeah, minivan looks like one giant bush. Good work, Rose.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;So what now?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Start moving down the track, Rose. We’re gonna have ourselves a nice sit down whilst we wait for Michael to walk back, catch him unawares so he doesn&#39;t cause no trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>And so they walked down the track and then into the trees lining it. I followed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Half an hour later they were sitting on a pair of tree stumps near the track, waiting in ambush for Michael. Ancient, looming forest towered over us.</p>

<p>Chopper still had his firearm of course. </p>

<p>Rose: &quot;You&#39;re very comfortable with that gun.&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Afraid that&#39;s what a life of unsavoury work and regret gets you.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;You said you were going steady with a girl once, you can&#39;t regret that?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;That was a long time ago. Reckon its best we just sit quietly and wait for Michael.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Tell me about her, Chopper. After I told you everything about Michael, after you turned it all against me. The least you can do is talk to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;You really don&#39;t need to know about her, Rose.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;But I want to know. And sitting in the dark waiting for Michael, it’s not like we have anything better to do than talk.&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Hard to disagree with that …&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Exactly. So tell me, what was her name?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Her name was – still is – Lori.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;You said you blamed her for things that weren’t her fault. What things were you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper let out a long sigh. </p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;When I met Lori I had to stop doing the sort of illicit work I’d done all my life. To keep ahead of the law I’d always taken up in a new state every few months. That life weren’t suited to anything more than a flashfire romance.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;So you straightened out when you met Lori?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Tried to. But I didn&#39;t exactly have the most respectable resume, ain&#39;t many places looking to hire a guy like me. All I could get was odd jobs, money got tight. I started taking it out on her. I said some bad things. Shouldn’t o’ been surprised when she up and left.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Did you try and get her back?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;No, I let her go.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;And then you fell back into your old life and work? This sort of work?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Tell me more about Lori.&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Well, how did you meet?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;I was celebrating after a job. Some bar near the safe house. Not exactly the smartest move, but I ain’t exactly the smartest guy. Anyway, the bar had one of those karaoke machines and I was drunk enough to give singing a shot. Ended up choosing Sonny and Cher but I needed a partner. I put it to the bar and, lo and behold, Lori appeared from the crowd. I can’t sing worth a damn but she had the voice of an angel. By the end of the song I was smitten.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;So you stuck around just to be with her?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Yeah. Once the heat was off the other boys moved on to their next jobs, but not me. I had reason to stay.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;You started dating?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Yes, ma’am. I don’t know what Lori saw in me but she agreed to let me take her out. I still had money from the job, so I wined and dined her and took her on day trips to the beach. Our first kiss was at the local zoo, right in front of the sea lions. I swear the damn things cheered us on. Happiest day of my life.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Do you know where Lori is now?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Last I heard she’d set up on the east coast. Works in a laundromat, or so I hear.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;Have you ever thought of going to see her, telling her you’re sorry?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;Sometimes. A lot as a matter of fact. But if I ever do show up on her doorstep I don’t wanna be the same lowlife I was before. I wanna have money in the bank, I want Lori to know that I can look after her, treat her right. I guess that’s kinda why I’m doing this job.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose: &quot;If you need money to impress Lori, why didn’t you just take mine?&quot;</p>

<p>Chopper gave Rose a grave look.</p>

<p>Chopper: &quot;This ain’t about your holiday tokens, Rose. There are millions of dollars at stake tonight.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>They say money is the root of all evil. Fitting then that such riches are what drew such a monster to the mountain.</p>

<p>I truly hope I&#39;m not calling that monster back to this cabin. Final part soon.</p>

I’m not talking about accidental scratches during sleep, or little abrasions that may easily be explained away.</p>

<p>I’m talking about cuts that bleed into the mattress. Deep gashes on my arms, legs, and torso. I was getting scarred all over, and I had no idea why.</p>

<p>I figured I was sleepwalking, and decided to chain myself up whenever I slept. But the next day, I was uncuffed from the bed, the rod on the bedframe I had cuffed myself to was broken, and there was a note on my desk.</p>

<p><em>Please don’t ever do that again. Cuff us again and you very well might not wake up in the morning.</em></p>

<p>The note chilled me to my bones. The content, of course, terrified me. But what made it inexplicable was that it was written in my handwriting.</p>

<p>As I stared at that note, frozen into place by a paralysing fear, a whole series of movies, TV shows and books began swirling through my mind. Was this like Memento? Moon Knight? Jekyll and Hyde? Was there an evil, violent side of me, just waiting to burst through? Did it escape whenever I slept?</p>

<p>I must have sat there for a good few minutes just staring into space, mind whirring, heart thumping heavily. The doorbell startled me back to action.</p>

<p>Paying the pizza guy absent-mindedly, I got back to my room and began munching on the pizza in bed. Not the most hygienic thing to do, but my mind wasn’t exactly in a good place. I began researching what I could do. There were lots of information online. It seemed that a lot more people were going through things like these than I would have expected.</p>

<p>First advice I followed was to set up a camera. Luckily, I had a pet camera. I had gotten it when I first moved here a couple of years ago, fully intending to adopt a dog for company. As it turned out, it was just one of those things that I just didn’t get around to doing. Part of me probably realised I was too broke to be able to take care of a dog, and too busy to be able to walk it every morning and night. I rummaged through the storage room, found it, plugged it in and set it up. I downloaded the application needed to view its video footage through my phone, set that up as well, then aimed the pet camera at my bed. Then I placed some random books, candles and knick knacks around it, hoping that it would make the camera less obvious. I gave myself a mental pat on the back for having purchased the pet camera with the night vision capability.</p>

<p>Then I realised that I would need to cover more ground. As much as possible, in fact. So I headed out to get a body cam and a couple of surveillance cameras. I also bought a black light and some cans of tonic water.</p>

<p>When I got back home, I hunted down the box of teeth whitener I remembered having bought ages ago. It took me a while to locate it in the storage room.</p>

<p>Then I mixed it with the tonic water, and wiped the mixture all over my shoes. I poured the remnant onto the mat outside my house. It should stay wet for at least a day. Just to be clear, I read that black light illuminates things like teeth whitener and tonic water, and I was hoping that the next day, I would be able to pick up my footprints using the black light and see where I went.</p>

<p>I set up the surveillance cameras in my living room, outside my house, and a little down the block, though for the one down the block, I couldn’t set it up on WiFi and so would have to manually retrieve it to view the footage the next day. I hid it as well as I could, and could only hope that no one would find it and steal it.</p>

<p>When I went home, I wrote on a piece of paper, in a large font, <em>Who are you, and what are you up to?</em></p>

<p>I taped the paper right on the door, so whoever it was could see it before leaving the house. I also set up a portable reading lamp to shine directly onto the piece of paper.</p>

<p>I spent the day nervously messing around the house, trying to think of more things I could do to find out what was going on.</p>

<p>When night came, and I began to feel sleepy, I began to duct tape some magazines around my torso. I read that those were great for blocking knife attacks. I taped magazines around my forearms as well. Then, I clipped the body camera to my shirt, and sewed the wires to my shirt for good measure.</p>

<p>Next, I enabled the GPS on my phone and slid my phone, fully charged, into my pocket.</p>

<p>I settled down in bed. Despite the light from the desk lamp shining on the door, the discomfort of the duct taped magazines and my anxiety, I soon found myself lulled to sleep by a recording of a dog snoring. </p>

<p>I woke up the next day with my vision half blocked by a piece of paper. I pulled the tape on it off my forehead, wincing at the sting.</p>

<p>I flipped the paper around and looked at it as my vision cleared, and saw the words, <em>Thanks for the ‘zines</em>.</p>

<p>I looked at my arm, and noticed that there was deep cut across the magazine I had wrapped around my left forearm, splitting the pages diagonally.</p>

<p>I sat up, and felt an intense pain spring through my shoulder. I must have strained it during the night. Remembering the setup from the day before, anticipation pierced my chest, dispersing the remaining fog of sleep from my mind.</p>

<p>I got off the bed, relieved to find that aside from the strained shoulder, everything else seemed relatively unharmed. I checked out the pet camera. It was untouched, which meant that whoever it was had come out of the bed last night had not noticed or cared to switch it off.</p>

<p>I swiped across the pages on my phone to the pet camera app. It didn’t take much scrolling before I found the footage I needed.</p>

<p>There it was, just half an hour after I had dozed off, based on when my snoring started. I felt a chill spilling down my spine as I watched the unfamiliar movements of my body. The video showed me sitting up in the middle of the night, looking around and checking my arms and torso, uncovering my shirt to examine the magazines. It was me, but the actions were strange. A little jerky and very hurried. They seemed the actions of someone much more brusque than I was, someone paranoid and intense. I watched as “I” nodded my head and smirked, seemingly approving of the magazines I had taped around my body. I watched as my body got out of bed, then walk to the door. Here, my body, or okay, I’m just going to call whoever was using my body, It. For clarity’s sake. So it stared at the paper on the door, then chuckled. It opened the door, not bothering to respond to my message. I couldn’t help but feel irked. Such inconsiderate behaviour, for someone who was borrowing my body in my sleep.</p>

<p>I activated the apps for the surveillance camera, and grabbed my black light. The footage showed me getting out of the house and head down the road. I walked out to grab the surveillance camera I had placed down the road, and rushed back to plug the camera into my computer. Once I had access to the footage, I quickly scrolled to the time it would have walked by. Around 1am. The footage showed it walking for a distance before turning left and disappearing out of the camera’s view. I scrolled further, and saw it returning from the same direction, at around 5.45am.</p>

<p>I used the black light to try to trace where it might have gone past that turning, but the visible traces of its footprints reached only a couple steps past the turn. Damn it. In future, I would have to somehow make a puddle of the teeth whitener/tonic water mixture at the turn.</p>

<p>Undeterred, I scrolled through the GPS locations of my phone. The GPS data confirmed what the camera footage had shown. I know it’s a little overkill, but I just wanted to make sure that it didn’t fake the GPS location data. Having different sources of information to cross-reference stuff was a habit I have had for a long time.</p>

<p>The GPS data showed that it had wandered off the road near the woods. Of course. I mean, where would a creepy body stealer go in the middle of the night? To the creepiest woods in town. Of course. I sighed, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to resist going to check out its route.</p>

<p>I pulled up the footage from the body cam. It showed my body walking down the path the other cameras had shown, though the first person view made the surrounding night seem scarier, more menacing. I scrolled forward, until the part where it entered the woods. I saw lots of trudging through the dense growth of the woods, and my hand reaching forward here and there to push leaves and branches aside, as if checking for something on the trees. I paused the footage and replayed a section, having caught sight of something. There it was, my hand pulling aside a branch to reveal a small spot of red paint (it was too bright to be dried blood) on a tree. Here and there, the camera view showed spots of red paint on trees at intermittent periods. It was probably a trail of markings meant to guide whoever was using my body somewhere.</p>

<p>Finally, the view changed. From the seemingly endless mass of green brown and grey, there emerged a tiny clearing, one that seemed unnaturally empty and hollow, scratched out in the midst of the lush growth of vegetation. It stopped for a while, staring at that patch of lifeless ground.</p>

<p>Then the camera view swivelled and its face appeared on the screen. My face.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t see this,” it said, in my voice, but its intonation and rhythm made it sound like a completely different person. My gut twisted at the mix of familiarity and strangeness the voice held</p>

<p>The screen went dark.</p>

<p>I sat in silence, numb with dread. It knew I was watching, and it let me be. What was in the clearing? I had half a mind to stop pursuing things right there, to perhaps see a doctor, get some medication that could keep my body from moving at night. Perhaps this was all just me sleepwalking. Sleepwalking that led to an elaborate, complex series of actions There had to have been similar cases.</p>

<p>A quick search online quickly squashed my hopes. Sleepwalking could get really wild, like people waking up to find themselves driving somewhere in the middle of the night. But I found no instances of the sleepwalker being that aware of their surroundings, to the point of being able to seek out trail markers, realising that they are being recorded and leaving notes and messages for themselves to read or see while awake.</p>

<p>A huge part was also that I just couldn’t see it as just sleepwalking. It didn’t explain how I got out of my cuffs, how I got back to bed each time, and why I acted so differently on the footage.</p>

<p>I had to find out what was going on. I had to check out that clearing, get to the bottom of things.</p>

<p>I went home to stock up on things that I’d need. I re-taped magazines around my limbs and torso and tucked a Swiss army knife into my pocket (I didn’t have any cooler knives that could be easily carried around without attracting attention). I found my winter gloves and tucked them in my backpack. I found a mini garden shovel and a torchlight and packed them too. I recharged the body cam and scheduled an email to be sent to my only friend in this place, the only one I trusted, anyway. The user login and password to access the footage from the body cam was in that email. Just in case I didn’t get back by 10pm tonight, the email would be sent out and my friend would be able to know what happened to me.</p>

<p>I soon ran out of things to delay my journey. Reluctantly, I strapped on the backpack and clipped on the body cam, then headed out the door.</p>

<p>I soon reached the start of the woods where my body had entered last night. Despite playing the footage over and over again, it proved ridiculously difficult to trace the route that it had taken last night. After spending nearly 3 hours wandering around trying to follow the path shown on the footage, I was ready to give up. Then, I lifted a sagging branch and spotted a red paint mark on a tree.</p>

<p>My heart pumped with adrenaline. There it was. I was on track.</p>

<p>I took at least another hour for me to find the rest of the red paint marks that led me to the clearing.</p>

<p>Stepping into that small barren space, tentacles of dread twined their way up my spine. I knelt down to examine the ground, swiping about in sand and mud. There seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary. I pulled the mini shovel out and dug around for a bit. It seemed to be nothing but soil for the first few inches. I was beginning to think that perhaps there was nothing more to the clearing, when I heard it.</p>

<p>Some muffled cries, from beneath.</p>

<p>My throat constricted, and my heart began to pound. I began to dig in earnest, desperately shovelling up soil and mud. The cries became clearer. I was able to make out a few words, what sounded like, “No”, “leave me alone”, “help”. Around a metre down, my shovel hit something hard. I cleared the soil and mud away from the hard surface, and uncovered what looked like a trapdoor.</p>

<p>It was locked.</p>

<p>Staring at the mud-caked padlock, I wondered where the other me could have hidden a key. Considering how it was using my body, it had to have the key on me, in my room, or somewhere easily accessible. The footage didn’t show it retrieving any key, and I hadn’t found anything on me either. The key had to be around here. I looked around, unsure where to begin the search. I stared at the trapdoor, wondering if I could somehow break the lock and pry it open. That was when I noticed a faint outline of a key on the top left corner of the trapdoor. I ran my finger over the key shape. The key was fitted into the trapdoor, I realised. A near perfect fit, showing just the faintest traces of its seams.</p>

<p>I pulled out my Swiss army knife, and pried the key loose after a few tries. I listened to the continued cries from within, my gut brimming with fear. Trembling, I fumbled with the key for a full minute before I managed to insert it into the keyhole.</p>

<p>“No, please! No more! Please!” The voice kept wailing.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath, held the shovel in one hand, and turned the key in the lock. A loud click temporarily silenced the cries.</p>

<p>I reached out and placed one hand on the handle, braced myself, then pulled.</p>

<p>The trapdoor was heavy, but opened easily enough. It must have been opened recently.</p>

<p>I looked down to see a ladder.</p>

<p>The voice was loud and clear now. “Please, stop hurting me. Please just stop!”</p>

<p>I stared nervously down at the area lit by the square of light from the trapdoor entrance.</p>

<p>“Hello?” I called down.</p>

<p>“Just stop…” The voice rang out, followed by loud sobs.</p>

<p>Carefully, I stuck one leg down onto the first rung of the ladder. It held my weight. When nothing happened, I placed my other leg down to the next rung. Nothing happened, and the voice stopped.</p>

<p>I scurried down the rest of the ladder, and turned hurriedly to face the direction where the voice had come from. Holding the shovel out in one hand, I reached the other to the side of my backpack and pulled out the torchlight I had packed. I shone it around.</p>

<p>I froze when the round beam of light skimmed across a figure in the corner.</p>

<p>I pointed the light back at whatever it was that I had seen and steeled myself.</p>

<p>A dark figure crouched at the corner, huddled up and shaking.</p>

<p>I squinted, trying to make out its form and shape. It was a young man, dirtied, dishevelled, with clothes torn and stained with what seemed like patches of blood. His left eye was swelled shut, and there were cuts on his arms. He was tied up, chained to the wall. He looked up, and the haunted look in his eyes chilled my heart.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” I asked, a tremble in my voice.</p>

<p>“Just stop. No more games. Please, just let me go. Or kill me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Who did this to you?” I asked, not daring to move any closer.</p>

<p>He stared at me, a desperate expression on his face. “Stop it, please.”</p>

<p>I took a tentative step forward, and he flinched, covering his head and leaning back against the wall.</p>

<p>“Stop what? What’s going on here? Who did this to you?” I asked.</p>

<p>He continued to cower away from me for a few seconds, then slowly lifted his head. He looked fearfully at the puzzlement and shock on my face, and seemed to study me for a few more moments.</p>

<p>“You aren’t playing games? You really don’t know what’s going on?” He asked timidly.</p>

<p>I nodded. He stared at me for a long moment, then spoke again. “You are not…Marlene?”</p>

<p>I frowned, confused. “Marlene? No. I’m Jodie.”</p>

<p>A look of understanding dawned on his face. “You’re Jodie. You’re the real person. The real owner of your body,” he said, hope beginning to fill his tone. He lunged toward me and stopped, constrained by the chains.</p>

<p>I took a few steps back, startled.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to save me. Please! Before Marlene comes back.” His tone was urgent, pleading.</p>

<p>“Who’s Marlene? Why are you here?” I asked, looking up at the entrance. There was a mania in his expression that scared me.</p>

<p>“Marlene…she’s the one who takes over your body. She took us all. She hurt us. She killed the others. Using your body. We…we didn’t recognise her at first,” he cried. “Please, let me go, free me. Please!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Why would she…why my body? What are you saying?” My mind was reeling in shock, unable to process much of what he was saying.</p>

<p>“You appeared before us a few days ago. You told us you needed help, your dog had fallen in hole in the woods. You lured us here. Knocked us out somehow. Trapped us. You told us you were Marlene. Back to get us. Using her body. Your body. Marlene’s spirit, she takes over your body…” His words tumbled forth like a torrent.</p>

<p>“That’s crazy,” I said, interrupting the flow of jumbled words. “You’re saying there’s a spirit called Marlene, who takes over my body? That she used my body to get you guys, whoever you are, to trap you here, that she killed other people? With my body?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she told us. We have never talked to you as you, only always as her, in your body.”</p>

<p>“Why would she want to do this to you? Why would she kill…the others with you? If what you said was true? And how would someone in my body be able to take down you and whomever else?” I asked, still incredulous.</p>

<p>“She seemed to have supernatural strength when she was the one in control. She killed my brother and my dad. She left me here, to torture me. She’s going to kill me. Please, let me go.”</p>

<p>The earnest terror in his voice got to me. I took a few hesitant steps forward, and saw the hope and anticipation rise within him.</p>

<p>I paused, just a few steps away.</p>

<p>“What are you waiting for?” He snapped, a touch of hysteria lacing his voice. I stepped back, shocked.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said, “I’m just so scared. Please, let me go. Save me.” His voice was soft and pleading.</p>

<p>I softened, and took a step closer to him. Then another.</p>

<p>“Why did she do this to you?” I asked, watching his face carefully. I saw a flicker of resentment and guilt cross his face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I have no idea. She’s insane. She’s dangerous. Please, just cut me free,” he begged.</p>

<p>I stared at him, and couldn&#39;t help but hesitate again. That was when he lunged at me. I stumbled back, narrowly avoiding his grasping hands.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry! Please I just want you to set me free! I just really need you to save me!&quot; His voice broke with emotion.</p>

<p>I stayed where I was. I was beginning to feel extremely uneasy. More so than I was already, anyway. Something seemed a little off about him. Maybe it was the way he spoke. Maybe it was his mannerisms, or his expressions. But I felt a sudden wave of mistrust towards him.</p>

<p>“What’s her full name?” I asked. I needed to know. I needed something to research. To find the truth.</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>“If you don’t tell me her full name, who she is, I’m leaving right now. And I’ll never come back here. Not as me,” I tried to steel my tone as much as possible, to convey my determination to him.</p>

<p>He stared at me, a tinge of hatred seeping into his face before he resumed a fearful expression. “Marlene Toa,” he spat out.</p>

<p>“T, O, A, yes?” He nodded. I nodded in response, and turned to leave.</p>

<p>“WAIT! You have to free me! Please!” He cried out, voice breaking with terror. I strode on, refusing to look back.</p>

<p>“Stop! Don’t leave me here! She’ll kill me!”</p>

<p>I climbed up the ladder, ignoring his screams. At the top, I turned, and said, “I’ll go check things out. If things make sense, if you’re… I don’t know, if you’re telling the truth, I’ll come back and free you. Just give me a while.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be time! She’d be back by night, please! Don’t do this!” I shut the trapdoor, muffling his voice.</p>

<p>Heart thudding, I began shovelling the soil back to hide the trapdoor. I checked the time. It was around half past 3 pm. Funny, it felt like days had gone by since I woke up this morning.</p>

<p>If I tried my best to stay awake, I probably had a full 15 to 20 hours to figure out a plan before I fell prey to sleep again.</p>

<p>I walked away from the muted cries, taking the trapdoor key with me. Marlene Toa. I needed to find out who she was. What happened to her. Why she took them, killed them, tortured him. Above all, why me<a href="https://teddit.net/r/TheDarkSeas/">.</a></p>

It’s even easier when your life in on the line in the process. </p>

<p>Lying is a fools game in the eyes of the universe, totally meaningless in its judgement of whether you were good or evil. It’s even more foolish when you plead the truth upon the deaf ears of the US judicial system and the con artists who keep it afloat. </p>

<p>It doesn’t matter who you are, where you came from, what you’ve been through or how many witnesses swear you were with them on those nights which coincidence decided you belonged behind bars. I’ve been condemned to the fringes of society and I’m disgusted that my death will coincide with the true monsters who walk alongside me. </p>

<p>My name is Anthony Bennett and I’m a free man. Perhaps not in the literal sense, not to the onlookers who only see a haggard, red-headed man pacing the chipped tile of his minuscule cell. No, not to them. </p>

<p>But, to me, I couldn’t be any more free. In the eyes of what’s good and evil, my mind is void of any guilt. If there’s an afterlife, which I doubt there will be, I know that I will run through the grassy fields of forever, uninhibited by the machine which dragged me here. </p>

<p>This I know to be true. </p>

<p>Today would’ve been my third month and third day awaiting the electric chair on death row. The worry of my name being called at this point, among the dozens of others who’ve waited several years, was very slim. It’s easier for them to draw the process out, to beat the fight out of you so that you’re death could pass as unceremoniously as possible. </p>

<p>It works. </p>

<p>As I said, I’m only three months in and I’ve done all the research, presented all the facts and pleaded my innocence dozens of times. It doesn’t matter what you say or how you feel if nobody is listening, especially when there’s hundreds of others pleading their case just as loudly. </p>

<p>It’s a shame that I’ve been swept under the rug so easily, after hearing the other inmates tales of innocence, of the flawed system, I can’t seem to understand how I’ve been grouped along with these people. Their stories have too many holes, their character issues ever present in the way they carry themselves.</p>

<p>I’m not like them and that is why I’m free. </p>

<p>Well, I shouldn’t say all of them spew total bullshit. Some had good reason to do the things they did, though it doesn’t matter when a book decides your fate. </p>

<p>If you’ll recall, it WOULD’VE been my third month and third day here with the creatures on death row. However, I’m beginning to think that the place we find ourselves now is much, much worse. </p>

<p>I’m not so sure what time it was when the guards ran their nightsticks along the bars of our puny prison cells, creating a symphony of wretched clattering which awoke us. I still remember the moans of my cellmates, pulled back into their hopeless reality with such force that their weary minds had forgotten this bleak place for the first few seconds they regained consciousness. </p>

<p>Not me, though. I can’t sleep with the lights on, which was the case for the entirety of the previous night because Andy Johnson just had to tell one of the guards he was going to “tear his throat out and shit down it”. Yep, that’ll lose everyone’s ‘lights out’ privileges for the rest of the week. </p>

<p>“Rise and shine, ladies, rise and shine!”, a short, husky man bellowed out into the echoing hallway of our block. Troy Bowers was a perfect example of what’s wrong with our prison system, allowing the loudest individuals to hold the most control simply because they could talk over everybody else. Nobody dared to say a word, to defy his demeaning attitude less they wanted to be beaten savagely, so savagely that there body would turn black and blue. </p>

<p>I could tell by the panic stricken faces of the more tenured inmates that something was terribly wrong. Most days we were left in silence, similar to forgotten children’s toys, our only interaction was the regimented feeding schedule and the occasional walks to go shower. Otherwise, it was bad news. </p>

<p>Our block was emptied, cuffed and shackled together before being escorted down various hallways of the prison, some I hadn’t even seen before. There was no chance to run, no chance to escape as nearly forty guards marched the twelve of us forward. </p>

<p>Truthfully, I was fucking terrified. As we marched along the barren, windowless hallways, my mind conjured up every possible outcome that awaited us on the other side. I was convinced they’d have us lined up and turned into Swiss cheese, it’d be easier to clear house and just be done with the lot of us anyways. </p>

<p>That all changed when we reached the tall, heavy double doors at the end of the maze. A small television was implanted into the wall just above the doors.</p>

<p>“We are ready to commence The Games”, the front most guard called out. I swear that I could hear his voice crack just a little as he spoke.</p>

<p>The screen lit up, offering just one simple word. “Welcome”, in a lime-colored, pixelated font. The sounds of the various mechanisms whirring and buzzing could be heard from all around us as the giant doors began to draw themselves open. </p>

<p>“What the fuck is th-“, one of the inmates, who I’d come to know as ‘Critter’, tried to speak but was quickly subdued by one of the guards. </p>

<p>“You keep your god damn, fuckin’ mouth shut, you hear me?!”, Officer Bowers screeched as he swung his nightstick over Critters head. Critter never was the sharpest tool in the shed, the hollow sound which bounced off his skull seemed like definitive evidence. Blood poured generously from the crown of his bald head, had he not been attached to the rest of us then he would surely have dropped like a fly. </p>

<p>Excessive force becomes the status quo on death row, as you can imagine, but even this seemed like too much. The rest of us were silent. </p>

<p>Finally, the doors fell completely open. The lights inside the room on the other side were nearly blinding compared to the usual dimness of our block. They marched us onward until the lights swallowed us entirely. </p>

<p>It took a moment before my eyes could totally adjust to my surroundings, though it felt as if the breath had been torn from my lungs upon seeing the massive extent of the room we found ourselves in. It’s hard to gauge just how large it really was, I feel like I’ve lost scale of things in the past three months I’ve spent in my cell, though if I had to guess I would say it was similar to a sports stadium. </p>

<p>Similarly to a stadium, the floor was covered entirely by a thick turf which shown a sickly green color under the bright overhead lights. The walls were covered in poorly painted flowers and trees which crawled to the very edges of the ceiling. It was difficult to make out what the ceiling looked like because of the massive, circular lights which casted blinding rays down upon us. Between the glaring lights I could somewhat make out a childishly painted sun and blue skies dotted with smears of white. </p>

<p>In the middle of the room, however, stood a building of its own. On the outside it looked like a giant, pink square without any doors or windows, though the closer they brought us had revealed the rough gray cement which the building was composed of. </p>

<p>If the guards hadn’t been there to promise us a swift beating, then I’m sure the panic would be even more present than the wide, terrified eyes of my ‘fellow’ inmates. Critter hung limp by his shackles still and I was afraid he was already dead, though the true outcome would prove to be far worse. </p>

<p>When they brought us here, to the pink building, the same guard called out those familiar words once more and a piece of the floor began to collapse and pull itself backward underneath the building. A stairway sat below it. </p>

<p>As we descended the stairs, into this nightmare, that’s when Critter awoke. His body seemed seemed to tighten and convulse as he regained consciousness. Thick wads of spit and blood poured from his mouth and began flying aimlessly in great showers as he began to laugh with such uncontrollable joy. </p>

<p>I tried my best to ignore it. </p>

<p>The other inmates began to panic and writhe in their shackles on cue with Critters meltdown. That’s when a cold, wet rag collapsed mightily over my nose and mouth. </p>

<p>Everything went dark. </p>

<p>I’m not sure how long I was out for, it didn’t seem like long. However, when I awoke I was completely alone, tucked thoroughly into a bed. My mind was in a haze and my body felt numb, but still I shot upward. </p>

<p>A desk, much like the one you would use if you were still in grade school, sat across from the bed in my small room. A spiral notebook, the very one I find myself writing in now, was accompanied by a pencil and a tiny, wooden box. Inside were a bunch of envelopes. The ceiling was suspended high above me, a single light casting a faint glow illuminated the neat room I found myself in. </p>

<p>It wasn’t long after I awoke that a soft, mechanical whir began to take effect. A piece of the wall began to pull itself upward to reveal a speaker. </p>

<p>“Good morning, ladies and gentleman”, an unnaturally deep and distorted voice came from the other side of the speaker. “I’m sure you’re all wondering where you are, but don’t fret... let us show you”. Somewhere outside of the walls a buzzer began to cry as one of the sides to my room began to jerk and pull itself up. </p>

<p>I think this new reality, this nightmare, really began to take hold once I saw the world on the outside. Behind my wall was a thick sheet of glass, at least I think it’s glass... it won’t break. About thirty yards across from me was another massive window, one of the other inmates was banging furiously against it. His room looked exactly like mine. </p>

<p>To the left and right of his window, were two more windows which revealed identical rooms with other inmates inside. Some of them I recognized, others I didn’t. I’ve gathered that we must be on the second floor because three more windows and three more rooms sit below them, all housing more terrified prisoners. Some of them screamed and tried, to no avail, to break through the glass, others simply sat or laid still on their beds. I’m not sure if they’re still sleeping. </p>

<p>The space between the walls was barren, save for a giant, colorful wheel with various symbols attached to each color. Some of these symbols were familiar, one was a spider and another was a thermometer, others I didn’t recognize. </p>

<p>“Welcome to the Dollhouse Games!”, there seemed to be an edge of excitement in the distorted voice, “You all have a debt to society that you will be given the chance to repay. You should consider yourselves lucky.” He continued. </p>

<p>I looked on at the chaos unfolding around me, perhaps the shock of it all had induced a sort of calmness, though I couldn’t help but notice Critter flailing and writhing painfully in the bottom leftmost room across from me. I think that’s what got to me the most in that moment. </p>

<p>“You each have a notebook in your rooms, on the inside of the cover is the number you will be assigned for these games. Please take a moment to regard this.” My legs moved, almost mechanically, under the command of this mysterious voice. </p>

<p>I flipped open the cover to the notebook. Inside, written in a fine, black script read the number ‘3’. </p>

<p>“You may write what you please in these notebooks, however you must seal it in an envelope and place it in the receptacle which will open at the end of each day”, the more the voice droned on and the more hysterical I saw the other inmates becoming had begun to take its toll.</p>

<p>My heart pounded with untethered ferocity. I was afraid I was about to faint, but I knew I needed to stay calm. There has to be an explanation for all of this. </p>

<p>“There are 24 participants in this years Dollhouse Games and only 1 of you will be leaving. However, there is good news”, I found myself trying, and failing, to not hyperventilate. The reality of our situation began to take hold. </p>

<p>This isn’t how it’s supposed to be. </p>

<p>“Whoever wins the Dollhouse Games will be allowed their freedom, this means you will have repaid your debt to society and you will be given a clean slate.”</p>

<p>My lips and tongue were so horribly dry. I wanted to scream, to beg and plead my innocence to the man behind the speaker. Even then, however, I knew that it was meaningless. </p>

<p>“Since one of our contestants is already incapacitated, we will use him as an example of how the games will be played”, the audio cut out directly after he spoke. </p>

<p>I began pacing wildly around my room, looking for any nook or cranny that may house a key or an exit which I could escape from. It was no use, this room is completely and utterly barren of any thing other than the desk and the bed. </p>

<p>I almost wish they would’ve just lined us up and shot us dead.</p>

<p>Do you have no mercy?</p>

<p>A few minutes passed as I sat on the bedside, trying to collect my thoughts and steady my breathing. When I stood up again, to face the outside world, I saw two men standing directly next to the spinner wheel in the courtyard. They were adorned in white body suits which clung tightly to their skin, their faces obscured by a pink mask with dozens of long ropes of cloth sprouting from their heads and down to their shoulders. Sort of like a mass of pink dreadlocks if that makes more sense. </p>

<p>“Let The Games begin”, the speaker came back to life. One of the masked individuals reached a slender arm out to the wheel and gave it a mighty tug. It seemed to spin on and on, the swirl of colors nearly making me vomit from how dizzying it seemed. </p>

<p>Finally, it stopped. </p>

<p>The symbol which it stopped at was the thermometer I had noticed earlier. A ball, sort of like the balls you see in a game of pool, dropped into a basket from the tube which jutted out below the wheel. The other masked man reached into the basket and pulled it out. Without a moments hesitation, he raised it to the sky to show us. </p>

<p>I could just barely make out the number 17 painted on the white ball. Critters number. </p>

<p>The white-clad men both disappeared from my sight and were replaced now by another mechanical noise. Four TV screens began to descent from above the courtyard, each one facing one of the ‘Dollhouse’ walls. The screens simply read “5:00”, in an ominous red font. </p>

<p>Then, 4:59, 4:58, 4:57, and so on. It was a timer. </p>

<p>The light in Critters room had turned a similar shade of red which seemed to grow in intensity as the timer counted down. </p>

<p>I wasn’t sure what the thermometer meant at first. I still wasn’t completely sure when Critter had begun to twist and writhe with such ferocity that I was sure his bones would stick out from the skin. However, as I watched closely with sick curiosity, I could see his skin begin to bubble and pop, wisps of smoke escaping the freshly opened sores. </p>

<p>Soon, much like the rest of his room, Critter was reduced to a blobby pile of melted, burning flesh and bone. Even through the thick concrete of the Dollhouse, of the sound proof windows, I swear I could hear the cries of his unparalleled agony. </p>

<p>“Player 17 has been eliminated”, that familiar voice called out. Truthfully, I hardly noticed the wall to Critters room collapse back into solid concrete, at this point it was simply a fight to keep my mind intact. </p>

<p>This can’t be real, can it?</p>

<p>Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>“This concludes today’s games. Please take time to rest and recover as you will all be given a task tomorrow. Thank you for your participation in The Dollhouse Games”.</p>

<p>I’ve been writing in this notebook since the games ended today. I’m not sure where to go from here... I don’t know what any of this means. Just please, if anyone finds this or sees this please help. Please. Please. </p>

<p>The slot just opened so I think I’m through with writing for the day. Again, if anyone finds this, my name is Anthony Bennett. </p>

<p>I am innocent.</p>

Me and my friend Sam decided to go on a vacation to Colorado. We recorded plenty of videos, because it’s not every day you go to Colorado. Looking back, I should have noticed that something was up.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>His weird behavior started around 4 days after we went into the mountains.  But personally, I noticed stuff that he chalked up to “nature stuff.” First off, we saw a weird creature running around. It looked sort of humanoid? But I saw antlers, so I thought it was just a moose or deer.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Later in the same day, we saw a red patch in the snow. We decided to reach into the snow to grab whatever was in there, and he pulled out a deer’s leg. Strangely, we couldn’t find the rest of the deer anywhere near. I chalked it up to a wolf just being a sloppy eater.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The next day, we found something even weirder. Another hiker saw us, and whipped out a knife. It didn’t look like it was made of steel, or any common metal. It honestly looked like silver, but there’s no way anyone would sanely make a silver knife when you can just use a cheaper material. He stared at us for a couple seconds, but eventually put his knife away.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I was relieved, I thought he would rob us for sure. But I waved at him, and he waved back. Sam laughed once we were far away, but I just told him to stop and think. “He may be following us!” I told him. Sam just laughed harder. After a bit, he eventually calmed down. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We kept walking, but I couldn’t shake off the feeling of being watched. I kept looking behind me, but I saw nothing. One time I thought I saw something disappear behind a tree, but I shrugged it off. As I looked ahead, Sam gasped. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>“Look behind you.”</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I whipped around, and saw the guy from earlier. He handed me a piece of paper and walked away. The piece of paper said the following.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>“Rabid deer have been sighted around Colorado. Avoid AT ALL COSTS, NO MATTER WHAT. If you get bitten, you may get rabies, or other animal transmitted diseases. Remember: AVOID AT ALL COSTS.”</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We decided to head back to the cabin we rented, but we heard a weird grinding noise. We saw a deer staring us down, and then continued whatever it was doing. It started scraping a rock with its antler. It looked at us again, and started foaming at the mouth. It started walking towards us, and we bolted. We heard it behind us, screeching. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Fortunately, Sam had a water bottle. He threw it at the deer, presumably infected with rabies. I think this because the water bottle snapped in half, pouring water all over the deer. The deer stopped in its tracks, and fell over in the snow. It looked scared of the water, like rabies infected animals do, but it looked more like it was… I know this sounds stupid, but hear me out. The deer KNEW that animals infected with rabies were hydrophobic, and it looked like someone acting a part.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I looked at it, and it stared at me with pure, undiluted hate in its eyes. We walked back to the cabin. At night, we heard scraping on the walls. I tried to call 911, animal control, anyone, but my cell service sucked.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We locked all the doors and windows, and went to bed. We didn’t have any weapons, so we slept in shifts. We didn’t want a rabid deer getting in, biting us, and causing us a slow, painful, death.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We woke up the 4th day, checked each other for bites, nothing. We decided to hike down the mountain, to a local camping store. We got guns, bear spray, bullets, and knives. We also got some hot dogs.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Since we’d stocked up on weapons, we decided to go hiking, armed this time. We saw a deer looking around our cabin. It was foaming at the mouth, and its antler seemed whittled down. We shot at it, and our bullets connected. It turned around, and reared up on its hind legs. Sam screamed and threw his knife at it. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The knife stuck into the deer’s head, causing it to recoil. It walked away, and seemed to be taunting us, begging us to shoot it. Its head was constantly facing me. I wanted so badly to shoot it, but that wouldn’t harm it. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We contemplated leaving, but it was getting dark, and a dark cloud was approaching. That meant more snow, so we decided to stay one more night. That was a huge mistake. I think that was why Sam caught rabies, or Zombie disease, or whatever happened.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The deer came back, and it started making a noise. Sniff. Sniff. Sniff. The sniffs increased in speed until they sounded like demonic laughing. It started slamming itself into our window. We quickly placed everything we could to cover it. We covered everything we could. We huddled near the fireplace, waiting for a cold rush of wind and snow to cover the window, and block the deer.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>But the snow never came.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I wish the snow had.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Truth be told, I always loved the snow. But in that moment, I loved it more. I begged it to come, to kill the deer. To protect us. I didn’t care that we might die. I just wanted that horrifying deer carrying that… abomination of a disease to die in a pit of snow. The snow didn’t come.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We barricaded the door. We didn’t think we’d survive. We decided to sleep in shifts again, so we could at least make the night feel a bit faster. I was asleep when I heard it. Glass shattering, and a scream from the living room. I heard something that sounded like paper tearing, and Sam screamed loud as he could. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I ran into the living room. The deer was gone. Sam was okay. Sam was white as a ghost. I decided to look outside. No deer. I looked at the black cloud. Past us. I pulled Sam into the car by force, and headed home.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>After a long drive of Sam never talking, we got home. I dropped him off, and headed to my apartment. I walked in, and collapsed on the bed. I finally got some sleep. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>In the morning, I texted Sam asking him why he was screaming. No answer. I called him. He answered, but he just kept breathing. He never answered anything. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I turned on the news, and was shocked.</p>

<p>“Two human bodies were discovered in the Denver mountains. One seems to have been dead a long time, due to its skin decaying away and its teeth being ripped out, but the other one is fresh. Dead by a self-inflicted wound, with the knife still in his throat. We have identified the fresh one, but due to the other one’s teeth being ripped out, we cannot determine their identity.”</p>

<p>The news showed a picture of the identified corpse. It was the guy with the knife. I went to Sam’s apartment to tell him what had happened, but the door was wide open. Everything in his room was destroyed. Muddy footprints went towards the road. A note was in the room. </p>

It was a really lovely place, the view was great, and we had a great time until something ruined everything. I always knew Transylvania as the home of the vampires. Now I know it as the home of something much worse. </p>

<p>On our first day, a guy called Sandor introduced the place to us. He showed us the cabin. It was small, only had a living room and a bedroom, but it was enough for just a week. He also talked about the history of the place, which was near a small city called Balan, if I remember correctly. It was a mining town during the soviet occupation, but all the mines were closed decades ago. </p>

<p>Sandor told us to visit the city if we have the time or run out of food because it’s a nice place and only a few kilometers away. We paid him the price for our stay, then he walked away. </p>

<p>So, the first day was great. There was even a river nearby. When I walked around the cabin to explore the place, I noticed some footprints near the back of the building. A lot of footprints, actually.  </p>

<p>“Hey, do you see that?” I asked my wife. </p>

<p>“The footprints? Yeah, I see it,” she responded.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange? Like there is a lot, and I’m not sure if it’s human or some kind of animal.”</p>

<p>“It’s summer, of course it’s full of footprints. There were a bunch of tourists here before us.”</p>

<p>The rest of the day quickly went by, and I wasn’t bothered by the footprints anymore. We went to sleep a few hours later. I woke up at about 3 in the morning when I heard my wife speaking. </p>

<p>“The footprints?” she asked. “It’s summer, full of footprints.”</p>

<p>I turned my head towards her. I could see her worried face in the night, but I didn’t quite understand what she wanted to say. </p>

<p>“Huh?” I responded. </p>

<p>“It wasn’t me,” she whispered with a worried voice. </p>

<p>I was even more confused, thinking about what the hell she was talking about. I’m too sleepy for this, I thought. </p>

<p>“What… what wasn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything. I heard the voice too, but it wasn’t me! There is someone else here.”</p>

<p>She sounded panicked. As I processed her words, I became worried too. I was thinking about Sandor, maybe he just came back because he forgot something there, but then I remembered that it was a female voice, which sounded exactly like my wife. </p>

<p>“We need to do something, I’m scared,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything,” I heard her voice again, but she wasn’t speaking, and looked just as scared as me. </p>

<p>“The sound came from under the bed,” I said and started shivering. I watched too many horror movies about monsters and killers hiding under the bed and hoped it was just some bad nightmare. </p>

<p>“There is someone under the bed?” she asked. I had to look at her every time she spoke to know if it was really her talking. </p>

<p>I looked at the desk beside the bed, trying to find something to protect ourselves from whatever was hiding under our bed. There wasn’t anything useful there except my car keys, so I grabbed them along with my phone, which I used to illuminate the room.</p>

<p>I looked under the bed, prepared to see something horrifying down there, but there wasn’t anything. </p>

<p>“There isn’t anything here,” I looked up to my wife. </p>

<p>“Are you sure?” she asked. “I’m sure the voice came from there.”</p>

<p>“There is someone under the bed?” I heard her voice coming from under the bed again. </p>

<p>“What the hell is going on?” I said. </p>

<p>“Please, just call the police and leave this place,” my wife said. </p>

<p>“Help me move the bad,” I said. “Just drag it a few meters away, so we can see if there’s really something under it.” </p>

<p>We moved our bed, and what we found under it was surprising and scary at the same time. It was a large hole, leading into a cave underground. I illuminated it with my phone. It was deep, full of spiderwebs. I think I saw rails about ten meters deep. </p>

<p>“Why is there a cave here?” my wife asked. </p>

<p>“It looks like it leads to a mine,” I responded.</p>

<p>“Why would someone build a cabin like this on top of a hole?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know, maybe it was an entrance the miners used, I have no idea.”</p>

<p>“And now what?” she asked. “What about the voice we’ve heard? It sounded just like me!”</p>

<p>“Maybe I should go down to check if there is someone there. Maybe somebody is trapped down there and needs help.”</p>

<p>“Are you crazy? Don’t go inside, we don’t know what’s there!” </p>

<p>“Why is there a cave here?” We heard the voice again from the cave. I was frightened at that point. It was a bad idea to go there.</p>

<p>“Look, I’ll just check the mine, a minute and I’ll be back,” I said. The cave wasn’t that steep, so I could just crawl back out of it if I had to. I jumped down before my wife could’ve argued with me. </p>

<p>I went down and looked around. It was really a mine, with rails and an old mine cart in front of me. Then I looked behind my back and froze. </p>

<p>It was a creature about 4 meters behind me. I would say it looked humanoid, but it had multiple legs, like… around 5 or 6 very thin legs and two arms. It was about as tall as me, with dark green skin. Its head looked human, but I don’t remember seeing eyes on it. It spoke.</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” </p>

<p>It sounded just like my wife, but I could see the creature saying it.</p>

<p>“I’m happy I’ll retire next week. These things keep killing our workers,” the creature said in a voice that I couldn’t recognize. </p>

<p>They could speak. Then I saw another one walking behind him as a six-legged creature could walk. Then another one. I crawled back out of the cave. It felt like forever until I reached the exit, crawling to my room. </p>

<p>“Did you see anything?” my wife asked as soon as I jumped out of the hole. </p>

<p>“Get out, get out!” I waved towards the exit, then grabbed her arm and we ran out of the cabin.</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“There are things in the cave! Get in the car, we’re spending the night in the city, I’ll call the police!”</p>

<p>We left the country the next day. The police didn’t believe me, and I don’t think they even investigated the cabin. I only realize now that they couldn’t speak. They just kept repeating things others said. Maybe the unknown voice the creature mimicked was a miner who worked there decades ago. </p>

<p>There are creatures living in the caves, underground. The mines were closed for a reason, it seems. I think it’ll remain a secret for a while, as I haven’t found more information about those mines. I guess only time will tell.</p>

For those with an aversion to violence, both sexual and gore, you might want to skip this update.</p>

<p>If you missed the <a href="https://teddit.net/r/nosleep/comments/x08ett/i_found_a_journal_in_a_room_hidden_in_my_basement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">first part, here you go.</a></p>

<p>The first few pages were easier to copy. The events described were pretty awful, but overall weren’t anything like what would follow. I hope for the sake of the men he writes about that they concocted the whole thing, but as I said, it’s a slow process deciphering his handwriting.</p>

<p>I know the area around Ft. Collins pretty well. I think the area they’re describing is up the Poudre river, then down to Stormy Peak in the Rocky Mountain National Park, but I could be way off.</p>

<p>I’ve started to get super creeped out whenever I go into the room in the basement. It’s just…off-putting. Like how has it not been found in all this time? Why was it bricked shut, then covered in dirt? And why can’t I find any information about Captain Grady White that isn’t related to boating?</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s the next section. Sorry about the length, but I didn’t want to skip anything.</p>

<p><strong>From the journal of Captain Grady White</strong></p>

<p>May 26, 1856</p>

<p>I didn’t sleep well. I doubt it has any direct correlation to the story the three men told me yesterday, though I would be remiss if I said it didn’t linger in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>I came across WS Foster this morning as I was en route to breakfast. He was clearly suffering the side effects of whatever malaise had taken hold.</p>

<p>He informed me that he would like a chance to speak with me before I disembark. I’ve set aside some time tomorrow. He also pointed me to the enlisted men’s area to speak with two men that were eager to share a tale with me.</p>

<p>I thanked him and went about my day, securing last-minute supplies and planning the route of travel for the coming days. In the early evening, I made my way to meet the men and hear their accounts. They had been tasked with scouting out a route into the Rockies.</p>

<p>The men, Privates Jakob Crossly and Peter Bronson were hard worn and appeared to be the type of men one would refer to as &quot;mountain men.&quot; They told me a tale over drinks. I’ve attempted to transcribe it here as I fear I may forget the details later. I’ve conveyed it as they told it.</p>

<p><em>J: Well, we were tasked with scouting the canyon up to a few peaks, We’ve been calling ‘em Stormy Peaks due to they always have those stormy-looking clouds around them. Plus, the snow still covered them. We were eager to go since this camp is nothing but bending an elbow with the boys every night and feeding the horses. Haven’t been on patrol in over a fortnight.</em></p>

<p><em>P: So we were eager. Jake and I were ready in no time and had our orders. We was to get to the top of the pass and head north, then come back around the foothills.</em></p>

<p><em>J: It was a long journey, but we wanted out of here. Between you and me, this place has had the hairs on my neck standing at attention for months, and I was looking forward to putting it behind us. Packed and left, then were up the mountaintops in no time. After four days, we made the destination. Petey here fell off a slide along one of the benches and had me roaring, so that was a start. This was up to the western side of the peaks. Well, he slides down a piece.</em></p>

<p><em>P: A fair piece, I recon 150 yards. Maybe 200. Hurt something terrible. I got up and started my way back up, with Jake coming down to me. Halfway is when we found it. Deep, too. Must’ve unburied it from my slide down.</em></p>

<p><em>J: Sure was. I didn’t have eyes on it, so when I got to spitting distance, I hear Petey hollering to all hell about something but couldn’t yet make it out. Next step, and I’m falling through the air. Landed five feet down at the entrance to the damned thing. Sat there like a damn child waiting to find out if I was broke or not, then Petey was there, outta breath and squawking to me about falling. Course I fell. I was sitting in a god-forsaken cave, weren’t I?</em></p>

<p><em>P: He sure was. Anyway, we sat for a while, then I lit a lantern. We walked into the cave about, what, Jake, 500 feet?</em></p>

<p><em>J: Sounds right.</em></p>

<p><em>P: 500 feet. Then there’s this…movement. The air starts moving around. A breeze, then it keeps growing. And it starts to make a sound, and I hear a whole group of people whispering. They weren’t making any sense. I couldn’t make out anything from it.</em></p>

<p><em>J: Then I hear it. It’s my name. Swear to Christ himself. My name is being whispered to me by these whispers in the damned wind. I hear it plain as day. Nothing to be seen around us, but we keep hearing this constant whispering. Then a gust of wind comes through, and I feel this, don’t know what to call it. It was as if I were suddenly standing in a field full of bison running for the hills, but they were just out of my reach. Some of them brushed by me, though were only up to knee height or so.</em></p>

<p><em>P: Same here. I heard my name, though. Still gives me the willies. My hairs stand on end right now, remembering that damned cave. I felt those things flashing by us in that wind, and I started praying. I ain’t prayed since I was young and would catch a cuff if I didn’t pray with the other kids at supper. Then, just like that, it stopped. No more whispering, no more wind, nothing.</em></p>

<p><em>J: Nothing at all. The cave was still empty. I looked over at Petey and tried to keep my wits about me. Told him it was nothing but the wind. He agreed. We took a few more steps, and that’s when it happened.</em></p>

<p>They both fell silent for a moment. I spoke up, thinking the drink had taken them.</p>

<p><em>Me: When what happened, soldier?</em></p>

<p><em>J: When we saw it.</em></p>

<p><em>P: It was right there. Wasn’t there before we exchanged those words, then looked ahead again, stepped a good five feet, and there it was. White as bleached bones in the desert.</em></p>

<p><em>J: It was staring at us like we was something to eat. It was eight feet tall if it were a foot. Its head looked like a wolf skull after it’d been skinned, only you know, giant. And the rest of its body was part flesh and part bone. Ribs sticking out of its skin, its long, spit-slick tongue hung out one side of its jaw, and I could make out part of its spine through what should have been its guts.</em></p>

<p><em>P: Don’t forget the clothing. That…thing wore a pair of trousers. I say wore, but really, the slacks were mostly rotted off it and were held on by suspenders. There was no belt nor any boots, and the lower legs were naught but bone.</em></p>

<p><em>J: It had a bone in its hand, sharpened on one end to a fine point, with some sorta Native decorating done on the other. Its hands were nothing but sinews stretched across bones and god-awful claws. It didn’t need that bone to kill us. It coulda done us in with its claws, no problem.</em></p>

<p><em>P: I just stood there. It was staring at me, and I felt its eyes boring holes into me, into my very…what’s the word?</em></p>

<p><em>J: Soul,</em></p>

<p><em>P:</em> <em>Yeah, as if into what makes me who I am. At first, I thought the eyes were empty, just empty sockets in that giant skull. But then I see them. These little glowing orbs. They started out like little sparks. Like coals smoldering, waiting to take flame. Glowing this dull red and growing brighter as it stares at me like it’s feeding on me. I started to feel cold, and everything around me got real quiet.</em></p>

<p><em>J: I was hollering at Petey to run, but he just stood there staring at it. I ended up having to yank him by his pack and drag him out the damn cave. He never said nothing, just slid along the floor, staring up at the ceiling. When the sun hit him, he started screaming. Went on like that for a good few minutes. I looked back at the cave, and that thing was right there, staring out at us.</em></p>

<p><em>P: I got no memory of any of that. Nothing until he threw cold water on me at the campfire half an hour later. I was still staring that thing in the eyes as far as I knew. It was talking to me, telling me things that I never want to think of again. Things that ain’t no man meant to hear, no man meant to know.</em></p>

<p><em>Me: Do you remember what it said to you?</em></p>

<p><em>P: ‘course I do. How could I ever forget that? I remember every detail. I remember the words, the pictures it put in my head, all of it. Hell, I even remember the smells. That creature fed me a full course of evil so dark that I thought for certain if I were to ever get away, I would be cracked.</em></p>

<p><em>J: You were already cracked, so that ain’t no different.</em></p>

<p><em>P: Yeah, probably true. Anyway, it showed me things that I wish I didn’t see. Bloody things. I saw the worst of man and the worst of myself. I remember as a boy in the orphanage, I took a toy from another boy. It was a little soldier. He treated it like it was his only possession that mattered. I snuck it one night, and he searched and cried for days looking for it. Well, his ruckus made it so that we couldn’t sleep, so one night, me and the other boys we beat him in his bed. Real bad. The nuns came and took him out. They kept him in the sick room for a few days, and I took the little book he wrote in. Turned out his solder toy was from his papa and was all he had left from his family. That thing made me see that boy die in that room all alone. That wasn’t the last thing I saw before I was brought back with the water.</em></p>

<p><em>I saw a woman attacked by six men. They all had their way with her, then tied her up. They were all laughing and carrying on like it was sport. She was crying and begging them to let her go, but they didn’t. They took her outside and stuck her on the weathervane on the roof of her house. Took her hours to die. The worst part was her kids. They were tied up to a tree, watching the whole thing. Momma up there with the weathervane stuck in her lady parts and these men laughing about it. Their papa came home, and they done the same to the little girl while they made him watch. Didn’t kill him nor the boy. The papa did himself in a time after that, leaving a little toy soldier for the boy. No family. Same goddamned boy we…</em></p>

<p><em>Me: Petey choked on his words before continuing.</em></p>

<p><em>P: It got worse from there; things far more evil. Demons taking people, little creatures eating people from the insides…these little creatures, not but two feet tall, running through the tunnels and dark places in these mountains where no man should go. The beast seemed to control them or at least guide them. I saw them set upon an entire native village and leave nothing but bones in their wake. They moved silently until enough of ‘em started creating a sort of breeze. Then the names of those to die would lift up outta that god-forsaken air. I saw them pulling children apart, pulling little babies apart by their arms and legs. It was awful.</em></p>

<p>He fell silent for a moment, clearly reflecting on the horrors the beast had shown him.</p>

<p><em>P: Then it went into my own head again. It showed me the last days of my momma. I didn’t get to know her too well since she died when I was young. She kept me in a room above the saloon she worked at. She’s bring men into the room, but I was so little then I didn’t know nothing.</em></p>

<p><em>A man took her hard one night while I was asleep in the chest of drawers. I remember it. I heard her crying out like she wanted him to stop. I couldn’t remember what he said until the thing showed me.</em></p>

<p><em>It showed me that he had been cutting on her, telling her that he was going to keep going hard until she was dead. The poor woman fought hard but were no match for a bastard that size. I heard the sickening crunch as he bit into her flesh. He bit again and again, over and over until she stopped struggling. I stood up outta the chest of drawers and watched the blood drain out of her into a silver decanter he held underneath her throat. He looked at me with a smile and told me to sleep well. Left money on the bureau and walked out. I tried to get her to talk to me until one of the other ladies came in some time later.</em></p>

<p><em>Then he showed me more…</em></p>

<p><em>My own momma burning in hell…</em></p>

<p>At this point, Petey broke down and couldn’t continue. He was sobbing as Jake patted his shoulder and took over.<em>:</em></p>

<p><em>J: As we said, that land is bad. There’s some true evil up there. Stay away if you know what’s good for you. Petey ain’t been right since. He’s volunteered for every mission that has a chance of dying. He wants to die, and I don’t blame him. I don’t want him to have this hanging on him no more. I want him to be okay. Ain’t no priest here in camp to help, neither.</em></p>

<p><em>Me: I’ll get you both leave. See a priest. Maybe they can do something to ease his suffering. And yours.</em></p>

<p>We ended the conversation, and I retired for the evening. I plan on getting the two a pass. I have no reason to doubt the story, though I have no reason to put any stock in it either. It seems they went through some sort of trauma and need to take time away. I believe they are suffering from some type of joint hysteria if such a thing is true.</p>

<p>Until tomorrow,</p>

A long, grueling year has passed since my brother committed suicide, but thanks to my dad’s help and assurance, I could keep myself afloat in the ocean of despair. However, I was still a miserable being who couldn’t function properly because I was cripplingly depressed and needed medication to survive. Until couple of months ago, my life changed significantly.</p>

<p>For the last few months, I have been hearing my brother’s voice from inconspicuous places, from hall, living room, and even from my father’s bedroom, asking me to get a bottle of soda from fridge or telling me what game I played today. Even though I knew that he is dead and these voices are not real, I simply panic and sometimes cry. This happened multiple times to the point I would just crawl in my bed and wonder if he came back as a ghost to haunt me for the rest of my life. I usually calmed down and sat back to my desk, trying to continue studying or just listen to music in my bed until I fall asleep.</p>

<p>A week ago, I was riding a bike at a park close to my house, and decided to rest in the grass. The sun was hiding under the clouds and the gushing wind made me fall asleep. Then, I had a nightmare where I was drowning in an ocean before I woke up to an intense rain in the middle of summer.  I immediately returned to home but I couldn’t avoid catching a flu. However, I was going to have it worse.</p>

<p>Last night, I did something I shouldn’t have done, but it felt like it was the right thing to do. My brother was an avid fan of pianists, so my dad bought him a piano. He would occasionally practice his skills, and I would accompany him to give feedback. After he passed away, my dad brought it to our new home because one of his friends wanted to buy it, but he kept bringing excuses for reasons I am not aware of. Then my dad put the piano in the basement, which then he proceeded to forget about it. I was furious, how dare he would put the piano, my brother’s treasure, into the darkest place in the house and forget about it? My heart was already broken from thinking about these too much. So, I decided to go to basement to play it. I was not sleepy; however, my eyes were bloodshot from the stress I accumulated for the last few days.</p>

<p>So, I walked. I knew that this was not a good idea, but we all do things we don’t want to, and this was not an exception. It was a cloudy night so it was a bit hard to see. Eventually I came to the door of the basement. I felt as if my whole body was being crushed between two anvils, I was sweating like a river. I hesitated for a moment, however there was no going back now. I didn’t want to look behind because I was afraid of confronting something I was not ready yet. After standing there for a good while, I opened the door. It was even darker, like the dark corners of space, or even like an astronaut drifting to a void in space. I slowly walked the stairs, being ready for a monster to jump at me and end my life. That did not happen, strangely I was at peace. There was no noise, no annoying voices, just pure silence.</p>

<p>After sitting at the stairs, enjoying the silence until my eyes adjusted to darkness, I saw the piano in all of its glory. Some places were bruised and there was a lot of dust everywhere but, it was as good as ever. I sat down, my whole body, especially my hands were shaking. Then I got emotional, but this was not the place to cry. I knew what I had to do. So, I played what he loved the most, Gymnopédie No.1. I did my fair share of training with him, and this was one of the only pieces I knew how to play.</p>

<p>As I played it, I could feel something manifest behind me. I definitely did not see what it was, nor I dared to peek at it. I just played as it stared at me from the depths of darkness. However, the more I played it, the closer it got to me. I just played the piano, like an invitation for it. Then, it spoke:</p>

<p>“Sister.”</p>

<p>I stopped. I was not ready for this. I did not want to cry. I bit my tongue to stop myself from crying, however I couldn’t stop myself from tearing up. Then, he sat next to the piano stool, right next to me. I did not want to face him, because I was afraid of seeing something I did not want to. I did not want to see his hateful eyes again. I did not want to see him cry again. I did not want to see myself in his eyes. Simply, I held my hands between my legs and kept my eyes shut like a guilty prisoner. I could feel him staring at me, but I was not ready to look at him. Then, he spoke again: </p>

<p>“It is my turn then.”</p>

<p>I was surprised, and in a sense amused, to hear my brother playing piano after a long time. However, I still averted my eyes from looking at his face. Instead, I looked at his arms, which was shining like a beacon in basement’s darkness. I calmly listened to him playing Gnossiennes No.3. He was calm and did not hesitate in any note. I felt relaxed in his presence, I could feel every negative feeling leaving my body like a flowing water. I mustered enough courage and for a moment peeked at his face. He gave all of his attention to the piano, and he was not hateful nor sad. He was happy.</p>

<p>I did not look away until he finished his piece. Then, the moment I waited for so long came. We both looked at each other in content. I felt happy, after a long time of crippling depression, I was finally happy again. This time, I spoke:</p>

<p>“Would you like to play with me, brother?”</p>

<p>He nodded, and as if we unanimously decided in our minds, we played Gnossiennes No.5 in unison. After playing it for so long, I got intensely emotional. After not seeing my brother for so long, and now playing piano with him, gave me feelings that I could neither explain nor have the courage to talk about it. We finished playing it but I was tearing up again. My brother seeing this, he held my hand and said:</p>

<p>“I am glad to have such a strong sister like you. Thank you for being with me.”</p>

<p>I could not hold myself anymore, I surrendered myself to my emotions and cried for a long while. While crying, I got really exhausted and my tiredness won over me. I woke up to sun setting from the small window and looked at the piano. Everything was in place, except my brother. </p>

<p>Since then, I stopped hearing voices and seeing things. I would like to think that my brother’s spirit has helped me to keep me going, otherwise I might not have survived that night.</p>

<p>As a final note, remember that you are not alone and thank you for reading.</p>

When I got there, I couldn’t see anything at all, not in the driveway, or in the part of the garden that was visible from where I was standing. I felt like a fool, when suddenly I heard a voice that startled me.</p>

<p>‘Hey there!’ a voice, soft and sweet came from behind me, ‘What are you doing?’ she said, I could hear the friendly smile in her voice, and knew I could easily resolve this situation, after all, I probably looked weird as a stranger poking around her property.</p>

<p>I turned around to face her, she was a small woman, with long blonde hair, she had unstriking features, except for the huge toothy smile plastered on her pale, pasty face.</p>

<p>‘I’m so sorry – I must look like I’m trying to rob you or something,’ I stuck my hand out, channelling my small amount of charisma ‘I’m Lucy, my friend used to live here and he asked me to come look around to see if he left anything, he’s so forgetful.’. I felt embarrassed to lie, but I couldn’t exactly tell the whole story to this random person I’d only just met.</p>

<p>My bullshit clearly worked, though, because the next words out of her mouth were ‘That’s very sweet of you, come in for a cup of tea and I’ll show you what the previous owners left.’</p>

<p>And so, I followed the random person I’d only just met into her home. It was strange to see Brendan’s house decorated so differently, his cabinets by the door filled with unfamiliar belongings, other people’s shoes neatly lined up on the floor, alien rugs and lamps littering the entry hallway. The new dark green wallpaper imposed upon me from the rigid walls it was shoddily adhered to. ‘A shame’ I thought to myself, ‘It’s so ugly in here now’.</p>

<p>After we’d finished chatting and drinking our teas, she disappeared into the house and came back what felt like hours later with a cardboard box. Inside lay random things, akin to a charity shop jumble sale; I felt disappointed as I rummaged through, finding only items worthless to my endeavour – a cricket ball, a huge gimmicky spoon, toy after toy – presumably thrown into a hedge somewhere by young Brendan or one of his brothers, and never retrieved, until at the very bottom I saw a brown piece of paper – except it wasn’t paper – I couldn’t tell what it was until I touched it and felt the cold leather on my finger tips, and the paper pages bound between. A book. Some hope. I shakily lifted the book onto my lap and pulled open the cover; inside it read: ‘Clair’s Diary – Do not touch’.</p>

<p>Clair’s POV:</p>

<p>June 1999</p>

<p>I think the man I married is a psychopath.</p>

<p>My parents raised me to be silent and humble, to speak only when spoken to, to be less than them, but I just couldn’t; they trampled on my dreams of becoming a teacher and told me to do something ‘better’, to ‘rise above’ the bullying I faced from my sisters and at school. They tried to crush every ounce of spirit out of me, but were unsuccessful. Through every screaming argument and punishment I received in that home, I silently promised myself I would escape, and become something greater than what my family could even hope for themselves, and that I did. I packed my bags the second I turned 18 and got into my little blue Ford Fiesta and drove off into the big scary world. The day was cold, wintery, dark -  I felt my world crumbling as my car bumbled away from that place, inch by inch, mile by mile, hour by hour; and instead of the relief I expected to feel, I felt my heart get crushed by a different type of darkness – feelings like vulnerability, uncertainty, anxiety, but much worse, much more terrifying. At first I slept in my car, battling the freezing cold of the UK’s weather, printing off my resume at internet cafes, handing them in, only to never hear back, or get rejected - living on the little savings I had, scared, and lonely, until one day I was passing through a small town and I saw an advert tacked onto a corkboard in a quaint grocery shop – it read ‘CHILDMINDER WANTED’. ‘Childminder wanted?’ I thought to myself ‘It’s not a teaching job but it’s definitely a way to get my foot in the proverbial door of working with kids. And… I really need the money’.</p>

<p>That very afternoon I decided to charm my way into the job and called the number on the piece of paper.</p>

<p>‘Hello?’ a man answered, almost… Slyly? I felt a horrible, black chill go down my spine, and wondered if it was the wind. Of course it was the wind, I didn’t know anything about this man, I couldn’t have possibly got that feeling from one word, I was imagining things.</p>

<p>‘Hello?’ his voice was demanding, and I felt that same chill, I needed the job though. So I persevered. </p>

<p>Through the rest of the call I tried to numb myself towards his tone of voice – or rather - what I could feel behind his voice. Although nothing he said was overtly unsavoury, every word he spoke dripped with phlegm, annoyance, and almost hatred. I had no idea why – I was friendly and respectful the whole conversation, but alas alack, I chose to forget about it and hope he was nicer in person. I found out his name was ‘Simon’ and I told him my name, and then we arranged a trial childminding session.</p>

<p>A few days later I arrived at the house, a huge house, with a modern walkway and neat garden. Bordering the property were big evergreen hedges and trees, blocking the house from being viewed at any angle except the front. I saw a shape moving in the front window, just for a split second, before disappearing from view. With discomfort building in my chest, I lurched forward toward the front door, noting the 3 security cameras pointed at different areas in front of the house. I knocked, and inside I could hear a child crying, then some shuffling, before a figure emerged behind the frosted window and instructed me to go round to the back entrance of the house. As I walked around the building I almost panicked, my mind racing with stories of young women going to informal jobs like this and getting murdered before turning the corner and being suddenly greeted with a barking ball of fur.</p>

<p>‘That’s Barli…’ a small voice said from the half open doorway.</p>

<p>I knelt down to stroke Barli’s fur and looked up to see a girl who couldn’t have been older than 9 or 10 standing above me with a tennis ball. The girl had a tear stained face and red cheeks, and I wondered what it was that made her cry.</p>

<p>‘I’m looking for Simon, is that your dad?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘Yeah, I think he’s inside…’ she trailed off and half gestured to the door behind her.</p>

<p>‘Ah, you must be Clair.’ Said the dark figure now standing in the doorway ‘Come on in’.</p>

<p>And then... Black.</p>

<p>I’m in a dark room and I’m writing this on a pad of paper, it’s so cold. I don’t know where I am. The door is locked.</p>

All the windows were boarded up with framing Lumber, and in red letters, the words Stay Out were written on the surface. The front porch was plagued with cobwebs, and a giant padlock reinforced the front door. As a kid, we were always taught to steer clear of Woodman&#39;s estate. However, I could no longer resist the lore of that place, so I planned to investigate. </p>

<p>The family that used to live there mysteriously vanished one day, and their disappearance is a dark secret in our community that no one likes to discuss. A lot of people speculate that the family was involved in some witchcraft, which resulted in their disappearance. Another common theory is that the father killed the entire family and fled the country with his mistress. No one knows what happened, and the police closed the case years ago, but I believe there has to be more to this story. </p>

<p>I arrived around midnight and began to weave through the forest of dead trees and cars. I used a stick I grabbed off the ground to slice my way through the cobweb that infested the front porch. I planned to use a pair of bolt cutters to cut through the padlock; however, as I attempted to cut the lock, my bolt cutters broke. Moreover, I noticed weird carvings and incantations on the padlock that I&#39;d never seen before.</p>

<p>After several minutes of stripping the lumber from one of the window&#39;s, I was finally able to make entry into the house. I was surprisingly shocked by how clean and maintained the place looked inside. The house had been abandoned for over five years, yet there wasn&#39;t a cobweb or spec of dust in sight. Furthermore, all the lights in the house were on, which was very odd because the city should have turned off the electricity years ago.</p>

<p>While searching the rest of the house for clues about the missing family, I noticed more carvings and incantations. On top of every door frame, there was a carving of a headless lion with incantations underneath the carving. I was curious about the meaning of the carvings, so I tried a reverse search of the image. However, whenever I took a picture of the carving, I couldn&#39;t find the image in my photo gallery. </p>

<p>After searching the house for several hours for Clues, there was only one area left unchecked, the basement. The basement door wasn&#39;t like any other door in the house because it didn&#39;t have carvings or incantations above the frame. Moreover, the door itself was a  mirror with a black handle as a doorknob. At this point, I was reluctant to continue my investigation, but I pressed on.</p>

<p>As I slowly descended the stairs, I was horrified to see a group of naked men and women standing at the bottom. I tried to run back up the stairs, but the door slammed shut. The group of individuals started chanting something in a language I didn&#39;t understand. I was so afraid they would kill me that I passed out, and when I woke up, I was in bed.</p>

Here&#39;s what&#39;s happened.</p>

<p>So it was at the end of the week, I was speaking to my friend, also a final year CS student, and he had some leftover pizza from the night before that he wasn&#39;t planning on eating, and he offered to give it to me between lectures the following day, and I, being the usually hungry person I am, said yes. So fast-forward to the next day, it&#39;s still morning, but after his last lecture, and in-between a few of mine, he messages me asking to meet up near one of the buildings on campus, though he doesn&#39;t have the pizza there at the moment (he didn&#39;t want to walk around with a pizza the entire morning), so the plan is for us to go to his commune and just get the pizza there and then head back to campus. Before we leave one of our other friends bumps into us and we all decide to just go together. His commune is really close to campus, probably less than 500 meters if I had to guess, so it it wasn&#39;t a long walk.</p>

<p>We arrive at the commune and all kind of just stand in his room chatting for a bit, since I wasn&#39;t in a rush to get back to class yet. But now comes the part that&#39;s the reason I&#39;m sharing my experience, I ask him at one point if I can use his bathroom, he says yes of course, but tells me something along the lines of &quot;just try to be safe&quot;, I sarcastically laughed it off, thinking he was just teasing/mocking me, since teasing each-other is something we do relentlessly.</p>

<p>Before I go on, I should mention that this is the first time I&#39;ve been to his commune (not to say he&#39;s still somewhat of a stranger to me, just that I&#39;ve never been there before).</p>

<p>But anyway, back to what happened, I laugh it off, close the door, and sit down, while I&#39;m sitting though, things just suddenly start to feel off, him and our friend seemed to go silent in the other room, the noise from outside seemed to die down, no more cars from the road nearby, no more sound from the other people in the commune, no wind or birds, even the sounds I was making seemed like it just didn&#39;t travel far, it just felt unsettling. But then all of a sudden I did start hearing something, scratching noises in the roof, faint noises from outside (he had a slightly opened window in his shower) that almost sounded like a form howling or gasping, and then a noise from his tap and showerhead that sounded like empty pipes, none of these sounds were very intense, but they filled me with indescribable dread immediately, in a way I&#39;ve not once felt before.</p>

<p>I immediately started rushing to finish off, and it started to feel like I was racing against something that&#39;s coming for me, I wanted to almost start crying because of how afraid I was but I couldn&#39;t, after I got up from the toilet and wanted to wash my hands, I could barely bring myself to do it because it would mean turning my back to a different door in his bathroom, this particular door was a glass door that lead to outside and was covered by a curtain. By the time I managed to wash my hands I thought I was going to have a full-blown panic attack, the scratching in the roof has become faster, the other strange noises seem to have spread all around, all still relatively low in volume, but all around, and it felt like something was about to come for me. I rush to open the door and the moment I do, everything goes back to normal, I open the door to my friends busy laughing at something they were just joking about, the noises outside went back to normal, the noises from the bathroom stopped, and it&#39;s only then that I realised that the light in the bathroom also changed, after I opened the door things seemed natural again, and I realised that while I was in there, the light through the windows and from behind the curtains got brighter and brighter, almost like you turn the exposure all the way up on a photo in some editing app, I just didn&#39;t realise because I was on the verge of having a break-down because of the noises.</p>

<p>The moment I was out of the bathroom everything was back to normal immediately, and neither of them showed any indication that they experienced something strange, so I just didn&#39;t mention it.</p>

<p>We took the pizza, and walked back to campus, in the moment I nearly forgot what just happened, but the moment both my friends left, as I was walking to my next lecture, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it, and did my friend joke about what he told me before I went into the bathroom or was he actually serious. After my lecture, I went home, but now every time things get quiet, I get flooded with fear, not because anything happens, just because it reminds me of what happened while I was in that bathroom. It&#39;s 2:45am where I am right now and I&#39;m once again the verge of tears because I can&#39;t stop thinking about it, I&#39;m sitting on my bed in the corner of my room and feel to afraid to close my eyes because I keep worrying that whatever happened in that bathroom will happen again.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t spoken to anyone about this because I would probably seem insane, but I wanted to post this here because I don&#39;t know what to do anymore.</p>

That is the time period in which most burglaries occur. Why do I know this? As a kid, my biggest fear was burglary. I would wake up to the slightest creak in my house’s floorboards and made sure to always, always lock my bedroom door. On the off chance that there was a fire, I was more than willing to take my chances.</p>

<p>One night, in particular, my house’s alarm system began to go off. Petrified that someone had breached my house, I quickly crawled across my bedroom floor to my closet. I hid there for over an hour, even after the alarm stopped. Our alarm system has malfunctioned, but at least I knew I was able to take precautionary measures to protect myself, even if that measure was simply a closet door.</p>

<p>Twelve years later, I still lock my bedroom door. Except now, I don’t have the notable protection of my dad’s guns or my mom’s insomniac alertness. Now, I am three stories up, where I felt safe that no one could reach me. Who would go through the trouble of ascending three flights of stairs <em>just</em> to break into someone’s apartment? I still don’t know the answer to that question.</p>

<p>11 am. I was craving a pumpkin cream cold brew. I closed the door to my apartment, ready to make my way to Dunkin. Fortunately, Dunkin is merely a mile away. I had an internal battle with myself about locking the door; my keys were already in my bag, and I didn’t want to spend time trying to find them. I always leave my door unlocked during the day by accident, and this didn’t feel any different. I continued to Dunkin and shortly returned to my apartment.</p>

<p>As soon as I stepped into my apartment, I was met with the strong smell of marijuana. I hesitated at the entrance and noticed that something felt <em>off.</em> “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told myself as I slid off my sandals and plopped onto my couch. All of my electronics, and I mean all of my electronics, were still perfectly displayed on my desk. Not a single item was displaced, and that was of great aid in my own reassurance.</p>

<p>3:27 am. I open my eyes. Silence. My fan is off. Being extremely paranoid about noises, I always have to sleep with some form of white noise. I begin to reach for the fan remote when I stop, frozen in my bed at the sound coming from my living room. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn’t believe my ears. I continued listening, hoping that the noise was coming from a neighbor’s house. Thud, thud, thud. It’s not.</p>

<p>3:29 am. I text my friend as the noises continue. I don’t know why this was my first instinct. Everyone asks why I didn’t call 911 myself. I ask myself that, too. My friend is awake and tells me she called the police. They’re on their way. I’m frozen in bed. How can this be? I have <em>prepared</em> for this. I have a taser on my dresser and a knife in my drawer. Still frozen.</p>

<p>The banging on my front door stops. While most people would feel relaxed at this, I only tensed more. Were they in my house? My mind began to play tricks on me as I saw shadows dancing across the crack of my bedroom door. If they were inside, all they would have to do is force open my flimsy bedroom door. I would still be sitting there, frozen, basically asking them to harm me. The self deprecating jokes about wanting to die become really unfunny when you think you are about to die. I don’t want to die.</p>

<p>3:54 am. The police are here. I sprint to my front door and swing it open. An officer peruses my apartment before deciding no threat, despite the dents that run along my door. As soon as the police are gone, the tears begin to fall. No stopping. I’m sitting, having the worst realization I have ever had in my life. Someone just tried to break into my apartment. Not just tried; they were more than insistent on getting in.</p>

<p>4:25 pm. I am sitting at my kitchen counter right now, writing this. It’s past the time period for a likely burglary, but I am now convinced Google misled me. I bought a Ring for my front door and have an extra safety lock. It doesn’t amount to much. I haven’t slept in days. I don’t feel safe in my own home. I continuously relive that night, asking myself the same question. Why did I freeze?</p>

<p>If you look into the psychology behind fight or flight, you will notice there’s another action, or lack thereof: freeze. While it seems counterintuitive to make no action at all, apparently it is a way for the body to prepare itself for action. Would I have taken action if the individual had breached my bedroom door? I don’t know. I tell myself I would, just so I don’t feel entirely useless in my own skin. Fight, flight, freeze. I hope I never have to decide between those 3 Fs ever again.</p>

<p>Right before he tried to walk directly into it.</p>

<p>We were ready for it, of course. It’ll do that to you when you aren’t used to it. Two of our men grabbed him handily by the shoulders and pulled him back, heels dragging on the soft ground.</p>

<p>As he protested and struggled, I checked the markings on the ground. Four more feet and he’d give up and come to his senses. He would still feel the urge, as we all do, but that relentless impulse would dull to a more bearable thrum. A familiar dread curled in the pit of my stomach, an unwelcome reminder that my own body would so readily betray me should I be the next to slip up.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The edges of the portal shimmer, like the air above a car roof on a scorcher of a day. Closer to the centre, that shimmering air thickens… No, <em>congeals</em> and becomes murky, with a dark impenetrable-seeming core. Clearly exuding an unnatural danger, and yet so tempting. The unknown.</p>

<p>A portal to another dimension. A wormhole. A black hole. A gateway to a higher plane. Honestly, were these any more or less of an explanation than the professor’s?</p>

<p>No one knows. Because no one who has given themselves to that call of the void has ever come back.</p>

<p>Does it even lead to anywhere at all, or are you simply destroyed? Do you disintegrate into your component atoms, or is the very flesh melted from your bones as you die screaming into the abyss?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The latest iteration has mercifully materialised rather deep in the woods, so mitigation of its effect is more manageable. So far, they’ve appeared – among other places – in a quiet cul-de-sac, in the retail park on the outskirts of town, and in the worst incident to date, the school. The heavy silence we encountered in the schoolyard was unforgettable, a disaster of unimaginable proportion marked not by sirens or screams, but by birdsong and the gentle afternoon breeze.</p>

<p>They disappear as randomly as they appear, hours or days later, having consumed hundreds of poor souls or none at all. Every portal has opened within three miles of the centre of this previously sleepy, rural town. As with everything else related to the phenomenon, the cause is unknown. Research is ongoing.</p>

<p>There are only so many cover stories and clean up jobs the residents will buy before this blows up into something much bigger, I fear. People are dangerous when they no longer feel safe. Carbon monoxide leak, spree killer, mass suicide by a cult. At the very least, only so much ‘bad luck’ can befall one town before it gains a reputation for being cursed.</p>

<p>Maybe it is, for all we know.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Inside a ten-foot radius of the portal, unless there is someone or something to physically restrain you from doing so, you will be overcome with the urgent, all-encompassing desire to enter it. We blackly call this the dead zone. Something has gone very wrong should you find yourself here. The scientists say they do not know the mechanism by which this occurs. It emits no unique frequency, no pheromone-filled scent or toxin. No siren’s call drifts from within its depths. That they can detect anyway. It defies exploration or investigation.</p>

<p>Between ten and twenty feet away, is something of a grey area. The first exposure may affect you more severely than any other, and as such one must exercise the utmost caution on that first occasion. The professor, despite the warnings, seems to have been somewhat overcome with his own excitement on seeing the phenomenon for himself. Beyond this first encounter, the effect does not continue to dwindle, if anything, continued exposure seems to slowly yet surely chip away at your sanity.</p>

<p>When you reach the twenty-foot mark, that urge fades to an incessant drumbeat at the base of your skull. <em>What if? What if what if what if?</em> It is possible to ignore, but it takes discipline.</p>

<p>For one hundred feet around the portal, you won’t immediately be drawn in. Within this distance unsuspecting victims have a restless sense that they are missing out on something. An itch in the back of your head that says maybe you should <em>go and see</em>. Get up, take a walk. See where it takes you. It would be a mistake as you’ll soon find your your legs have carried you willingly into mortal peril.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I’ve seen many people cross through since I’ve been a watchman, most during the early days when the situation was out of control. It’s actually not easy to pass through the portal. You have to be determined - which they invariably are given all I’ve told you already. They push their way happily through the dark treacly core and onto wherever… or nowhere.</p>

<p>I often lie awake at night, praying the call will come to say they have made progress on how to shield us from it, or at the very least that the latest one has closed up and vanished. A small reprieve would be welcome. When I do sleep, it’s fitful and full of nightmares, my psyche offering up grim depictions of the depths of hell and all its creatures, guessing at what may lie beyond that gateway. It’s hard to cope, living in fear of something you have to constantly <em>remind yourself to be afraid of</em>.</p>

<p>Can you see the problem with guarding this malevolent tear in reality to stop people entering it?</p>

<p>It’s like parking a wheelbarrow full of smack in a rehab clinic for safekeeping, but the staff are as much addicted as the patients.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There is, of course, a system. It’s imperfect, we still lose men with alarming regularity. But until there are some developments on how to deal with this <em>thing</em>, we guard it. I have been doing this long enough to know that we are an expendable commodity.</p>

<p>Never step within the ten-foot radius. Prevent others from doing so, by force if necessary.</p>

<p>Guards posted closest to the portal work in short shifts, two hours only before rotating off. Shifts guarding farther out are longer but still restricted.</p>

<p>They give us pills to take daily - we aren’t told what they are, but we speculate that they may be antidepressants or something else that changes your brain chemistry. I can’t say they have helped.</p>

<p>In our downtime we are encouraged to occupy our minds, be it games, books, TV, podcasts, music, and to actively recall these when we are on duty. All the better to dull that urge that grows the longer you stand near the portal.</p>

<p>The men have their own talismans. Crucifixes, rabbits’ feet, obsidian, protection runes, black salt. All useless in my opinion, men of all beliefs have been claimed just the same. Some, myself among them, purposefully refuse any good luck charms. We take the knowledge that we are weak and unprotected against it, and the tiniest slip up could end us, and let it wash over us. We focus that terror, nurture it even, and try to recall that sense of dread the next time we approach for duty, even when it&#39;s like sand slipping through our fingers.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It’s exhausting, it really is. Fighting such a primal urge. Wouldn’t it be the most natural thing in the world? Surely whatever is on the other side must be better than living in fear? It couldn’t hurt to find out. I could be the first to come back and tell the others what’s through there.</p>

<p>I stepped eagerly forwards towards the shimmering air.</p>

<p>“MAN DOWN!” was the last thing I heard before the darkness consumed me.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>When I woke, I was in a hospital bed. I blinked blearily and recognised the field hospital we helped set up days before. My head was pounding, and my mouth dry as the desert. Classic tranquiliser hangover. A specially devised cocktail to drop you like a stone – last resort if you get too close.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re up! Good man, you know the drill,” said the medic, handing me a glass of water before I could open my mouth to ask.</p>

<p>I did know the drill. This was my second lapse this month. I’ve been doing this for four months. One of the longest serving men on the squad – there aren’t many of the original team left now.</p>

<p>I drank deeply, then allowed the medic to carry out his examination. “You’re the third one this week,” he frowned once he finished taking my pulse. “For a while we seemed to have things in hand, but it’s getting more frequent again.” He ticked a few boxes on his clipboard then hurried away.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It was only later as I laid in my own bunk that I mulled over his words. By now we hoped things would be getting better, not worse. I stared, as I often did, at the map of the area hung on the pockmarked wall. Each portal was marked by a red X, not a single one crossing a whisker over the black line delineating the exact three-mile radius from the centre of town. Perfectly contained.</p>

<p>Doubt washed over me like a wave of icy water. Not only do I have to contend with the horror of continually battling my own feeble mind, now a new thought reverberated around my skull. Are we merely expendable, or are we the experiment?</p>

I&#39;m currently in college studying drama but lost my part-time job at the local diner which gave me enough money to pay my monthly rent.</p>

<p>My classes were always too close to working hours for me to make it and I turned up late more often than not. It was stressful and my boss would always yell at me but hey, it&#39;s what put food on the table.</p>

<p>I treated the act of looking for a job like it was my new job, I was constantly searching for vacancies in my area that at least somewhat lined up with my classes. I must have attended over 20 interviews but no one wanted to hire me! I didn&#39;t think my interview technique was terrible and I had some work experience at the diner so I put it all down to a streak of bad luck.</p>

<p>One day, I was in class. We were doing improv with other classmates, taking turns on stage to practice. My professor would give us each a role and we had to try our best to stay in character and keep the scene from being stagnant and going in circles. I had fun, I always had fun in class, acting was my dream job and I wanted to be on stage someday, a real stage, or in movies. Really, just anything that would allow me to be someone else for a change, being me was no fun at all.</p>

<p>I was chatting with Emily, the girl sitting next to me, and my ongoing search for a job came up in the conversation. She told me that her uncle had come to town and he was opening a toyshop nearby.</p>

<p>&quot;He might need some employees,&quot; she said. &quot;Come with me tonight and you never know, he might like you!&quot;</p>

<p>I thought about it for a moment, a toy shop? That might be cool, better than working in a crumby old diner like I used to.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that sounds great!&quot; I said, &quot;Can you pick me up? I... can&#39;t afford fuel in my car if I want to pay rent this week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No problem, you can just come with me right after this class... Unless you have somewhere to be, that is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that&#39;s fine by me,&quot; I replied,</p>

<p>&quot;Great, see yo-&quot; She was cut off,</p>

<p>&quot;Emily, you&#39;re up!&quot; The professor bellowed and Emily stood up and scurried over to be assigned her role.</p>

<p>Later, after class was over, I met Emily in her car at the college&#39;s front gates. She drove us to the toy store as she told me about her uncle. She seemed to think he was great but I thought he sounded creepy, I didn&#39;t say that to her though.</p>

<p>Once we arrived, I was met with a blank storefront. The windows had metal grates over them and the sign had not been put up yet. Emily knocked on the metal grates and yelled.</p>

<p>&quot;HELLO!&quot; she cried, &quot;Barry, you in there?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as she said that, the metal grate shot upwards and the lights flickered on, revealing a colorful store with toys and decorations everywhere you looked. The inside had already been decorated.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Barry!&quot; Emily looked overjoyed.</p>

<p>Uncle Barry was a thin, short man with a bald head and short stringy hair poking out of his hears and a white moustache sitting on his upper lip. He hugged Emily and glanced over towards me.</p>

<p>&quot;Who&#39;s this?&quot; He said, pointing at me.</p>

<p>Emily explained that I was her friend from class and my job situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Barry said, thinking. &quot;you said you were a drama student, correct?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Come with me to the back, I think I&#39;ve got something you could do for me,&quot; Barry said and walked toward the doors behind the counter. I was ecstatic, surprised, and all of the above. I adjusted my jacket at followed Barry behind the counter.</p>

<p>Barry stumbled around in the dark for a moment before he found the light switch and let out a mumbled &quot;Ah, ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was going to search for someone to be the store&#39;s mascot, but it seems you&#39;ve stumbled right into my lap!&quot; He said,</p>

<p>&quot;Mascot...?&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes. You said you were a drama student, this should be right up your alley,&quot; Barry said as he lifted a sheet. Under the sheet was a giant pink dragon costume. It looked like a giant teddy bear, it had soft pink fur, giant green eyes with eyelashes and a large grin stretched across its face.</p>

<p>It was slumped over against the wall, it didn&#39;t even look like a costume but a giant plush toy or some sort of themed pillow. I&#39;m not even sure you could move in that thing with it&#39;s puffed-out gut and giant tail. It also looked a bit girly, with hearts printed on its fur and the fact that it was pink. I wasn&#39;t sure about this.</p>

<p>&quot;Good isn&#39;t it? I found it on the side of the road on the way here, so I cleaned it up and brought it with me, I have no idea why someone would want to throw this thing away, it&#39;s great!&quot; Barry explained, &quot;I named her snuggles, don&#39;t you think it would be great for the kids?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know what to think, I did need the money, but wearing this thing? That&#39;s going to be so embarrassing...</p>

<p>I must have spaced out because the next thing I know Barry put his hand on my shoulder and said, &quot;Well, go on then, Try it on!&quot;</p>

<p>I really need that money, and at least nobody would be able to see my face. I rolled the suit over, looking for a zipper and found one on the back. The zipper tab was a giant heart and it made me facepalm. I took off my shoes and slipped into the costume, it was all one piece and the interior was surprisingly soft. I reached back for the zipper and found I couldn&#39;t reach it with the costume&#39;s mittens so Barry had to zip me up.</p>

<p>I heard Emily giggle behind me and I awkwardly shuffled around to face her.</p>

<p>&quot;Aww, she&#39;s so cute!&quot; Emily said and wrapped her arms around me.</p>

<p>&quot;She?&quot; I thought, then shrugged it off.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, now get me out of this thing, I can&#39;t reach behind me by myself,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>Emily continued to hug me like I hadn&#39;t said anything.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello? Emily, get this thing off of me!&quot; I said, louder this time because I thought maybe the suit was muffling my voice. Again, she ignored me.</p>

<p>Emily waved goodbye to Barry and left in her car without me. At this point, I started to freak out. The suit was getting hot and claustrophobic, I wanted to go home.</p>

<p>&quot;Barry! Get me out of here, this isn&#39;t funny!&quot; I screamed, but he didn&#39;t respond. For the rest of the day, I sat in the store and watched some men put up the sign outside ready for tomorrow. I tried getting their attention but they also ignored me, like I wasn&#39;t a person but rather just another toy.</p>

<p>I spent the night there, I tried to escape when Barry left but he pushed me lightly and I lost my balance, falling onto a giant plushy tail, it would be a struggle to get back up.</p>

<p>&quot;Snuggles, you can&#39;t leave. You need to stay here and get ready for all the children tomorrow!&quot; Barry said cheerfully as he closed the door again, I heard his keys jingle and his footsteps as he strolled away.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t see a thing now that it was night so I resigned myself to just lying there. Why wouldn&#39;t anyone let me out? Was this just some prank? I didn&#39;t think it was funny. I know I always wanted to pretend to be somebody else but this was not what I meant.</p>

<p>The morning came and the shop opened. Children swarmed me as soon as the doors opened. The suit restricted my movement and I couldn&#39;t overpower them. All day, I was forced to take pictures and have snotty kids cling to me. It was hell. I constantly begged to be let out but nobody seemed to hear me, they didn&#39;t even treat me like I was human. Even Barry, who knows that I&#39;m in here, referred to me as &#39;Snuggles&#39; rather than my real name.</p>

<p>When the store closed again, I was left alone. This couldn&#39;t be a prank unless they managed to get that many people in on it. I screamed until my throat was sore throughout the day and nobody batted an eye. I stumbled around in the dark trying to get the zipper undone so I could be free from this prison.</p>

<p>I was sweating buckets in this thing, my throat felt like sandpaper. I was so thirsty that I tried sucking the sweat that had soaked into the mask for a tiny bit of water but it didn&#39;t help. My eyes, lips and mouth felt dry. My head was spinning, I felt extremely dizzy and sick. It also didn&#39;t help that I desperately needed to go to the toilet.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t so much sleep as pass out from exhaustion.</p>

<p>I woke up the next morning to more screams from children. I was trampled on as little kids stormed through the aisles. This day was going to be hell, even more so than yesterday. </p>

<p>At one point I was propped up for pictures but I was so tired that I could barely stand, I had to be held up. Once I was let go, I fell and heard the zipper catch on something and it opened. Hope gave me a tiny amount of energy to roll over and lift myself from the costume. Then, I passed out.</p>

<p>I woke up in the hospital, I was told that I had severe dehydration and heatstroke but that I would be okay. I left the hospital the next day after some tests but was told to come back frequently as I had contracted a urinary tract infection.</p>

<p>I spoke to Emily and asked her what the hell she was thinking, trapping me like that. She had no explanation for why she didn&#39;t ever let me out and just kept saying she was sorry. I was furious with her and resolved to never speak to her again, classes were awkward after that.</p>

<p>I went to Barry&#39;s toy store again after class and freaked out at Barry, he had no explanation either. Unbelievable. I snatched the costume and took it home with me. I&#39;m not letting him pull that stunt with someone else, it was torture.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sitting in the other room right now and has been for the past month. It&#39;s comfy to cuddle with now that it doesn&#39;t smell like sweat and grime after I cleaned it but I would never wear it again, that thing must be cursed or something.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I am NEVER going to be a mascot again.</p>

She isn&#39;t a small dog either. Her name is Laila and she is a German Sheppard I adopted from a shelter.</p>

<p>Now Laila has always been a good dog... nothing was wrong with her physically or mentally.</p>

<p>This is a big deal because recently she&#39;s been getting these weird fungal spots on her paws. I took her to the vet and they treated them, said they had never seen anything like them. The spots were black and filled with puss.</p>

<p>I stopped letting her outside it stopped for a while, but they only came back.</p>

<p>Now I live on my acre of land, just me and my dog in our house. We have neighbors but they&#39;re fenced off from us. I&#39;ve had grounds men come check out my property but they didn&#39;t find any traces of any fungi. I knew it wasn&#39;t something she was eating either.</p>

<p>Now one day I woke up and did my normal routine. I checked on Laila, brushed my teeth then hopped in the shower. As I was showering my back I noticed a deformity on my skin. I used a mirror and aimed it at my back and found numerous of the same fungal spots now on MY back! I quickly threw on clothes and rushed to the nearest MD now. </p>

<p>When I arrived to the MD now they told me it was also unknown of what fungi was on my back. They gave me medicine to treat the spots and they slightly went away. I tried to calm down and rest for the day and just assumed whatever it was must&#39;ve been contagious from Laila.</p>

<p>I went to bed at my usual time, made sure to apply the treatment and shower beforehand of course. But when I went to bed I just couldn&#39;t sleep. I noticed Laila wasn&#39;t asleep either? I went to Laila and observed her, that&#39;s when I realized how dried out her eyes were and how sluggish she was. I simply rubbed it off as part of this &quot;Fungal Disease&quot;. I took her with me downstairs to get some water, to put on her eyes and to drink. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when I noticed it. In the corner of the living room a mound of just... black lied there. It looked like a pile of dirt in a way, but it was also shiny? I took my phone and observed it. It looked as if it were... slowly growing? I gasped as I pieced the two things together. Whatever it was must&#39;ve been the issue. </p>

<p>I quickly called my groundskeeper, the only person I knew who dealt with fungi. It took a while but he finally arrived. I told him where it was and he seemed shocked. The fungus was definitely larger from when I first noticed it and it seemed as if it slowly branched out as it increased in size. The groundskeeper put on gloves and took a shovel, driving it into the mass. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when I felt a severe pain all along the spots. It was as if adrenaline pumped into my veins. I looked at my body and I turned red. I could hear Laila whimpering at exactly the same time, followed by a menacing growl. I couldn&#39;t control myself anymore. My body moved to the man as I slammed him against the walls in my grasp. I started to cry internally, it felt almost as if my entire bodily system was taken under control. Suddenly Laila came running down. It looked at the man in the face, his head turned red as he struggled to breathe. Laila began to ravage at his body. She took parts of his flesh off and eventually limbs. I lost myself as I helped her. We dismantled the man and dropped him into the mound. The mound slowly consumed the parts of his body and grew. </p>

<p>The mound now sat in the corner, the size of a small sofa chair I&#39;d say. Both me and Laila were released. We both howled in pain and cried. The fact we just killed somebody broke me. I sat down staring at the mound shaking. The spots on my back felt as if they burnt. I took Laila with me to the car and we both drove far away.</p>

<p>Now we are currently at a hotel a few miles from my house. I&#39;m writing this now wondering what I should do. Please... I need help.</p>

Sure, we had a few rituals here and there but nothing too overbearing. Except when it came to her. Perhaps a small-town mystery or a scary story to keep kids in line come bedtime, the girl with the skipping rope had been a part of our hometown lore for over fifty years.</p>

<p>The rules were simple. After the sun went down, we were not to open the door if we heard a girl skipping rope outside. She would pretend to be lost and ask for her parents but under no circumstances were we to help her. If we ignored her cries for help long enough, she would leave us alone. If you grow up with something, you come to accept it as gospel truth, no matter how implausible it may be. To me, she was nothing more than Santa’s evil cousin who would visit us every couple of years.</p>

<p>I was around twelve when I had my first encounter with her. Almost at the cusp of my teenage years, I had decided to subvert my parents’ authority and watch late night TV. I had heard from extremely reliable sources at school that they would play reruns of all my favorite shows at 12 A.M. Besides, it was a Friday night, and I didn’t have to get up early.</p>

<p>My parents had tucked me in and were out in the kitchen wrapping up dinner. I waited patiently, staring at the light at the threshold of my door. The dishwasher started running and soon enough the lights turned off. Tip-toeing my way across the living room, I made myself comfortable in front of the TV. I had to increase the volume just enough to not arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>It was around 2 A.M. when I heard it.</p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p>I froze. I thought I had been busted, dad must have opened his door and found me.</p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p>I turned around but he wasn’t there.</p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p>Soon enough, I heard hushed knocks on the door. I knew enough not to open it; mom had drilled that into me. Yet something about the sound drew me to it. I just had to see her. I struggled but eventually decided to look out the window to see who this girl was.</p>

<p>I was pulling the curtains when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I was about to scream but a hand was on my mouth.</p>

<p>“What the hell are you doing? Shut up and don’t move.”</p>

<p>It was my dad. He had heard the TV and spotted me next to the door. He slowly pulled me back and carried me to my room, but not before I was able to see her. I couldn’t make out much; her black hair was covering her face and her eyes were pointed at the ground. She was dressed in white but was covered completely in mud and dirt. She just stood there with her rope, waiting at the door.</p>

<p>“What is wrong with you Erin? Have you lost your damn mind? Stay here. Let me get your mother.”</p>

<p>I knew I had messed up. Mom was going to kill me.</p>

<p>She came in and started frantically pacing around the room.</p>

<p>“She didn’t open the door, I caught her in time,” my dad said.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t understand. Being near her is enough of a curse. We are fucked.”</p>

<p>That was one of the few times I heard mom curse. After what felt like an hour of yelling, I was told to go into my room—I was grounded for a week. In that week, Father Brown stopped by to bless the house. Mom and dad became extremely reserved around me; you’d think I shot the family dog.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next month, there were rumors that she was visiting the town again. Behaviors radically changed. What was once a bustling community was now at a standstill. Lights would be out by 9 P.M. Kids were not allowed to stay out after dark. Church was packed every Saturday.</p>

<p>All of this seemed performative to me until Mark disappeared. Mark had been one of my closest friends at school and I had told him about my encounter multiple times. I knew he wasn’t stupid enough to open the door. The police treated it as a missing case, but we all knew what had happened. I was an inconsolable mess for the rest of the year. Needless to say, I didn’t ever stay up late again.</p>

<p>Mark wasn’t the only one, however, next it was Mr. Paul who lived by the river. Then Ms. Wu, who ran our town bakery. Finally, a little girl named Julia disappeared from her mom’s house.</p>

<p>The police didn’t know what to make of this. There were no clues to any of the disappearances. The doors were opened voluntarily—there were no signs of forced entry. The victims had seemed normal until their disappearance. No leads were ever found. Everyone stayed extremely vigilant; parents would sleep with their kids with a shotgun next to the bed.</p>

<p>Over the next year or two, the fear died down. No one really spoke about the disappearances or the girl, although it was always a lingering thought for most people in town. A good amount of people moved, and the state dedicated more resources and personnel to our city. With the Band-Aid of time, things got better.</p>

<p>Four years later, they found Ms. Wu’s body in the forest. From what they could make of the corpse, she had been choked to death with a metal object. Her face was brutally caved in, and her skull had significant blunt force trauma. By this point, however, she was nothing more than a footprint in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Eventually, I moved to the city. The girl with the skipping rope would pop up in my nightmares here and there, but besides that I never paid much attention to her. Life was busy and I wanted to move on from my small town.</p>

<p>I turned forty last year. Now with a daughter of my own, I realize that my parents did their best to protect me my whole life. Perhaps it was this thought that led to the events of last night.</p>

<p>“Mom! Someone is at the door!” My daughter startled me awake. It was 8 P.M. and it looked like I had fallen asleep on the couch. I got up to investigate.</p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p>My blood ran cold, and it felt like my legs were giving out. I picked up my daughter and locked her in her room. Twenty-nine years. Twenty-nine years had gone by. I didn’t believe this was happening. I was probably in one of my nightmares.</p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p><em>Clank</em></p>

<p>I didn’t know what to do. Suddenly, I was the scared child caught watching TV in the living room. The same force that compelled me to let her in all those years ago came back much stronger. I was able to gather myself and turned around to go to the room. From the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of her from the window. The same dirty white clothes, the same black hair, except this time she was staring right at me, her eyes piercing through my soul. She smiled at me and beckoned me to let her in. I decided to run, but before I knew it, I was in the forest being pulled by my neck. A thousand little knives being dragged across my back.</p>

<p>The legends got one thing wrong. The sound was not her skipping rope—she had always been holding a long metal chain.</p>

<p>And now she was going to kill me with it. I struggled and tried to break free from the noose around my neck. I heard her laughing at my efforts.</p>

<p>“Please. Please let me go. I have a daughter,” I struggled to get the words out.</p>

<p>Fueled by adrenaline, I pulled the chain forward to where I could catch my breath. I snuck out from under that chain and ran. I ran as fast as I could across the forest, but I could hear her following me. Someone spotted me by the highway and called the police.</p>

<p>At the hospital, I tried explaining the girl with the chain who had tried to kill me. Yet, no one would believe me. Temporary psychosis, I believe they called it. The doctors theorized that I had tried to harm myself and I was committed for seven days.</p>

<p>My daughter has since been staying with my mom and I can breathe a sigh of relief, because I know the girl will be waiting for me when I get out.</p>

<p>Stop copying yourself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I don’t know why I do it. Maybe it’s that of all the stupid things I could do to waste a computer’s time, this feels like the stupidest. </p>

<p>…</p>

<p><em>Ctrl+A Ctrl+C Ctrl+X Ctrl+V</em></p>

<p>Stop copying yourself.</p>

<p><em>Ctrl+A Ctrl+C Ctrl+X Ctrl+V</em></p>

<p>▯top ▯▯▯▯▯▯▯ yourself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Clearly the computer had had enough. Maybe I had too. I decided to make a sandwich. Then I took a long bath and tried to tune out my mental buzz. </p>

<p>Once I was reasonably dry, I went back to the screen. It was 3:33 AM, a terrible time to be awake. I was tired, very tired. But perhaps too tired for something so reasonable as sleep. So I did it one more time—<em>Ctrl+A Ctrl+C Ctrl+X Ctrl+V</em>—and Notepad shut down on its own. </p>

<p>I didn’t report the crash to Microsoft. In the back of my mind, I always wondered if they’d get a briefing of what I’d been doing that led to the passive aggressive existential unraveling of their thoughtfully constructed program. They’d probably put me on a list or something. <em>Useless Misanthropes - to be killed first in the great Microsoft Windows defenestration.</em></p>

<p>I looked at the clock again. 3:32 AM. Hmm. </p>

<p>It didn’t seem entirely fair that time should start backpedaling just because I had reached a level of dullness that Buddhist monks might quietly envy, but maybe it was my fault. I hadn’t really done anything to stop it. Defending myself against chronological entropy was the sort of thing that would take effort. I saved all my effort for Thursdays where the weekend was so close that no one would take notice and then make the mistake of expecting something of me. </p>

<p>Today was….possibly Tuesday. Who fucking knows. </p>

<p>By…3:15 AM…I had decided that Pornhub seemed like an appropriate use of my dark-room rectangular-screen-tunnel existence. I typed ‘Latina.’ <em>Ctrl+A Ctrl+X</em>. It felt problematic for some reason. ‘Sex.’ <em>Enter</em>.</p>

<p><strong>0 results.</strong></p>

<p>Huh. ‘Sex.’ <em>Enter</em>.</p>

<p><strong>0 results. *For you, you worthless piece of shit.</strong> </p>

<p>Ah…Right. My eyes had begun to sting. I shut them for just a moment. A long blink really. But when I opened them, it was morning. 7:13 AM according to my happily gyrating screen saver. </p>

<p>Four hours of sleep give or take. A normal-ish amount I supposed, but not enough to fix the fatigue of the previous night, just enough to stave off death for another day. </p>

<p>I tapped the Space bar and was prompted for my password. Fuck. My knuckles hurt. Bloody. Why I always seemed bloody or bruised or achy in the mornings, I couldn’t say. WebMD had told me that it meant cancer most likely. The kind of cancer that only prescription Cialis could remedy. <em>One easy trick for rock hard dick and flaccid everything else</em>, I think the ad had said. Or maybe the internet was running together, melting into an indistinct puddle of BUY NOW and SEE TITS and YOU’RE TERRIBLE. Oh well. </p>

<p><strong>Password:</strong> <code>Password1</code>\ </p>

<p><em>Enter</em></p>

<p>My browser was waiting for me in the same way that Beth wasn’t. She’d yelled the night she left, told me that she couldn’t be with someone so utterly devoid of passion as me. I think I responded with something daring like, “I mean, if that’s how you feel…”. She made a sound that I imagine a wounded herd animal might make. I stayed quiet like flavorless grass. </p>

<p>Maybe she was the reason I always came back to porn during the dullest parts of my nightly communion with the computer. If that were true though, I wondered why it was that I had opened the three tabs that led in some inscrutable sequence from Pornhub to LiveJasmine to DeadRose to HeartHappi. </p>

<p>HeartHappi looked like the kind of website that would sell hand cream to sporty white moms. A model smiled flirtatiously over a cup of cappuccino with styled foam; the font choice was modern, playful, but the words on the screen said:</p>

<p><strong>HOW NOT TO KILL</strong></p>

<p>My name looming in the top right corner of the page suggested that I’d already created an account. I wondered if I’d somehow sleep walked through a financial transaction for the privilege. Probably, though the day being possibly a Wednesday meant that I would have to ward off courting more depression until at least the weekend. It was better not to check my bank account. Its balance was too conspicuous, judgmental. No. I was a HeartHappi member for the time being. I accepted it and <em>Scrolled</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Studies show that blood under your fingernails…</strong></p>

<p><strong>…cathartic killing was reportedly not…</strong>    </p>

<p><strong>…but then I realised that I liked the screams more than the actual death.” <em>-Elle B., Leeds, UK</em>…</strong>   </p>

<p>There was so much text that I actually unfrowned when I got to something easier—an imbedded video. 7:—uh…or rather—<em>6:58</em> AM was just too early for reading in earnest. I <em>clicked</em>. The video loaded. </p>

<p>A soothing ebb and flow of Muzak played and I watched as a youthful racial-everywoman spread peanut butter on a piece of toast with a big fucking kitchen knife. She was smiling, beautiful, perfect teeth gleaming unattainably as she made the motions of talking without actually saying anything. Another knife scoop of peanut butter plopped onto the bread; too much peanut butter. She spread it over the sides of the bread and onto the fashionable countertop below it. The knife blade screeched across polished marble. She kept smiling. More peanut butter. The knife was getting close to her hand. Too close. She wasn’t paying attention. I was starting to sweat. And then she screamed as the knife sliced into the side of her index finger. The Muzak stopped and the words:</p>

<p><strong>STEP 1: REMEMBER TO BUY JELLY</strong></p>

<p>flashed across the screen. The woman looked to the left of camera, terror welling in her eyes as she gripped her bloody hand. Finally she said something. </p>

<p>“No! NO! GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM M—“</p>

<p><strong>HeartHAPPI</strong>™<br/>
<strong><em>Find a better you.</em></strong></p>

<p>I fluttered my eyes uneasily, my brain trying to process what I’d just watched. Maybe I was hungry? Or nauseous? For some reason I couldn’t tell which, but I did know that I needed to buy jelly. Jelly would fix most of my problems—it was a notion that I glossed over in that autonomic way that one does with things that need no internal debate. </p>

<p>A trip to the grocery store was absolutely out of the question though. I considered Amazon momentarily, but then my eyes roved to the top of the HeartHappi webpage, to the word <strong>SHOP</strong> nestled right next to <strong>Charlie Beckwith</strong>.  My simple useless name. </p>

<p><em>Click</em></p>

<p>The online store was minimalistic, boutiquey. A picture of a handsome man smiling over a cash register and a single item for sale. </p>

<p><strong>HeartJELLY</strong></p>

<p><strong>Price: $A,MOU.NT</strong></p>

<p>I stared at that price, sneering at how much sense every part of this website somehow made to an addled mind. My vision blurred. The part of my brain that typically processed misgivings followed suit. I needed that fucking jelly. An economist would have called my predicament the resulting price evaluation of demand inelasticity. But I wasn’t an economist, I was a sentient cursor, drawn by some ancient reptilian impulse toward a GooglePay icon. </p>

<p><em>Click</em></p>

<p>My purchase confirmation had a time stamp. 5:22 AM. A perfect time to unwake. I closed my eyes and</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“You like this wet pussy, Charlie?”</p>

<p>My eyes crept open to the familiar SoCal hues of the HeartHappi website.  <em>I</em> was wet, soaked really, and smelling pungently of some vaguely familiar chemical. I rubbed away sleep from my eyes, tried to focus on the screen, on the unmistakable (but notably blurry) shape of a naked woman. Did HeartHappi do porn?  </p>

<p>I listened to the glistening chewed banana sound of autoeroticism and tried to reach a sensible answer to the question. But my eyes continued to lag at resolving my sense of sight. Maybe I liked it?</p>

<p>“Um…it—uh—<em>sounds</em> good,” I replied. Had she said my name?</p>

<p>“It <em>looks</em> even better, Charlie. Just unblur me.”</p>

<p>Something about me still felt hungseous.  When was the last time I’d thrown up?  The question immediately rang as bizarre in my head. When was the last time I’d <em>eaten</em>? That was the normal question, right?</p>

<p>“You wanna eat <em>me</em>, Charlie?  Unblur me.”</p>

<p>Hmm... I had thought about eating. I don’t think I had said anything about it.  Something wasn’t right. Why would a hand cream website for sporty white moms also host porn?…and only sell jelly? </p>

<p>“Because milfs are trending, Charlie. So is fitness. Now unblur me, you fucking pussy.”</p>

<p>She was a little hostile for a cam girl, still blurry, but the rest of the website no longer was. There was an <strong>UNBLUR</strong> button at the bottom of the screen. My cursor hovered. I enjoyed female nudity. And I was terrible with confrontation. But in a way, cam girl’s hostility competed with the words at the top of the screen:</p>

<p><strong>STEP 2: BE OBLIVIOUS. DO NOT LOOK.</strong></p>

<p>“Charlie….” she mewled. </p>

<p>Oh, fuck it. </p>

<p><em>Click</em></p>

<p>She became clear and everything else abruptly did the opposite. </p>

<p>“Beth? What—how are you—what is this?”</p>

<p>It was her, unequivocally, undeniably, impossibly her, but her voice was wrong. And she was smiling, a strained hostage situation senior portrait kind of smile. And she was in my bedroom?</p>

<p>“I like this new rule breaking side of you, Charlie,” the voice that wasn’t Beth’s said. “It’s kinda sexy.”  Nude Beth didn’t talk; she never stopped smiling, but she made hand gestures to follow the speech. </p>

<p>“What’s happening?” I asked.  “Why are you doing porn?”</p>

<p>Porn Beth shrugged. Phone-sex-voice not-Beth answered, “Cause I like to squirt, Charlie.”</p>

<p>Beth nodded vigorously but she was…crying. Crying and grinning a broad teeth-gritting grin. </p>

<p>“Wanna see my pussy, Charlie?”</p>

<p>“Stop saying my name.”</p>

<p>Beth shook her head rapidly, eyes suddenly stricken. The camera panned down. To me. Lying on my keyboard, asleep, illuminated by the glow of my monitor. I was wearing the same clothes in the video that I was wearing at that moment…and also a headband with cat ears. Beth started huffing, shaking as she reached off-camera and produced a can of lighter fluid. </p>

<p>“Watch me squirt, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Stop saying my name!”—squirt—“Beth, baby, stop, okay?”—squirt, smile, terror, squirt—“Beth! Are you fucking crazy? Put the lighter down!”—shick, shick—“Beth! Please!”—shickshickshick—</p>

<p>The feed cut. </p>

<p><strong>HeartHAPPI</strong>™<br/>
<strong><em>Find a better you.</em></strong></p>

<p>I had smelled chemicals earlier. I was still wet, suddenly aware of fabric clinging to my skin, and as I reached to touch my head, I felt a triangle of fur, an ear. What was happening to me? Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck FUCK!</p>

<p>I looked at the time. It was 2:00 AM. I was tired. Where was that goddamn jelly?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The following (or possibly previous) morning came with a Gestapo-y knock at the door. I startled awake in bed. The time on my alarm clock was…irrelevant. 88:88 AM/PM. Not a real time, I was fairly certain. The knock came again, louder the second time, insistent. </p>

<p>“Coming! Hang on!”</p>

<p>I answered my door the way an agoraphobe or shy child might, huddled behind it, peeking out tentatively toward the prospective hell of another (possibly talkative) human being. But no one was there. A massive plastic drum stood imposingly in the hall instead, marked <em>HeartJELLY (Proprietary Electrode Gel)</em>. </p>

<p>My jelly had arrived!</p>

<p>I felt an odd sense of relief wash over me. But only for a moment. I looked beyond the drum. The elevator door just outside my own was open. There was no car, just a yawning shaft exhaling transient, brain-licking vertigo. I didn’t like it one bit, but as I gawked despite myself, I saw something written on the back wall of the shaft:</p>

<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> and an arrow pointing down. </p>

<p>I knew I shouldn’t look. It was crazy.  I hated heights. I lived on the ninth floor. I shouldn’t look. But I had already crossed the distance between my door and the shaft. I looked upward first—<em>why was I doing this</em>?—and saw the bottom of the elevator car a floor above. Treacherously dangling, an Otis brand guillotine caked in thick brown rust. I shivered. And then I looked down. <em>Why</em>?  Something about it felt necessary. Deep black hole. Nothing interesting. Just—I squinted into the darkness, blinked—two dull flashes of light, round shifting flashes…nocturnal eyes…<em>a face</em>…and then a whisper. </p>

<p>“<em>Jump</em>.”</p>

<p>I toppled backward onto the floor behind me, grabbed my jelly drum and heaved it, watching, terrified, as a long hand rose into the shaft. It popped three or four feet down its forearm. The flesh bulged around an ad hoc joint and the arm angled downward toward the ground, it began swiping around near my feet. I heaved again. The drum moaned against the tile floor. The fingers crawled spiderishly, searching. <em>Fuck!</em> Another heave. Another moan. Another. And I crossed my threshold. I kicked the door shut, then jumped to lock it and crumpled to the floor. </p>

<p>What the fuck.</p>

<p>Step 1: Done. </p>

<p>What the fuck. </p>

<p>Step 2: Failed. </p>

<p>What the fuck!</p>

<p>Step 3: Not a chance in hell.</p>

<p>I heard a soft knock at the door and shrunk away from it. Why was this happening? What was that thing in the elevator shaft?  Nine stories up. Nothing below. Its eyes had looked up from the center of the darkness. A massive spindly nightmarish thing. Impossible. </p>

<p><em>knockknockknock</em></p>

<p>Impossible…wasn’t it?</p>

<p>I crawled to my bedroom, stomach heavy, twisting spasmodically every time I heard—or thought I heard—another knock at the door. The numbers on my bedside alarm clock jittered and cycled manically as I drew up the covers. Noon. 2:39 AM. 3:78 PM. </p>

<p>11:11:11:11:11 M.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and made a wish as soft knocks at my windows joined those at my door. </p>

<p><em>Make it stop…please make it stop</em></p>

<p>I was tired. So fucking tired. Why wouldn’t—it just—leave—me—alone—</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Charlie! Meal is almost ready! Wake up lazy bones!”</p>

<p>Huh? No. I was dreaming. The voice was impossible. </p>

<p>“Charlie! You can’t sleep all unit, buddy!  We’ve gotta keep that heart happy!”</p>

<p>HeartHappi. Definitely dreaming. The voice was…mine. </p>

<p>“CHARLIE!”</p>

<p>I peeled the covers off of my face. My alarm clock was dead, blood pooling beneath a crack down its center. Alarm clocks weren’t supposed to do that, were they? </p>

<p>Fuck. Maybe I could…do…something…</p>

<p>Standing seemed like a good starting point. An achy starting point I realized, but it got me upright. I walked to the window. Opened the blinds. </p>

<p>It wasn’t night, but it wasn’t day either. It was orange. Everything—the sky, the ground, amorphous approximations of buildings—all of them were a bright tangerine-ish shade of orange. I closed the blinds and tried not to think about what that meant. </p>

<p>“Charlie! C’mon man! I made liquid meal! It’s gonna go all ephemeral if you wait too long!”</p>

<p>Something did smell like food—floral perfume and gin and imitation banana. Okay, so not like <em>food</em> exactly, but food adjacent. I left my room and dragged along toward the smells. A man was sitting at the little table in my kitchen</p>

<p>“Hey! Finally! Look—I made your favorite—reverie!”</p>

<p>He was wearing a gray cat costume, but one doused in something shiny and viscous. He ladled bright orange soup into a bowl and set it opposite his own. His face was…not right. </p>

<p>“Who are you?” I demanded. “How did you get into my house?”</p>

<p>He laughed. <em>My laugh</em>. “Oh my glib, man. Hilarious. How are you always so <em>on</em> right after waking up? I’m so fucking jelly, dude.”</p>

<p><em>Jelly</em>… Shit. I had left it out. This person had probably taken some. Maybe he took it all. But I needed it... </p>

<p>“What did you do with my fucking jelly, you bastard cat?!” I shouted.  A deranged outburst. </p>

<p>He sighed. Pointed behind me with a goopily sodden mitten hand. </p>

<p>I turned…and screamed. </p>

<p>My jelly drum was torn open, gutted, a ruin of twisted plastic and puddled clear gel. </p>

<p>No. What had he done?  I needed it. I didn’t know why, but I did. Now everything was fucked. </p>

<p>“Charlie…I can see you’re upset,” he commiserated treacherously. “Have some meal. It’ll cheer you up.”</p>

<p>I turned back toward him, livid, seething. His smallish porcelain doll face stared back at me, cheeks pink with mummer’s guilt, eyes black with sadistic indifference. His mitten hand raised a spoon awkwardly to his pursed lips, the spoon tilted, and orange soup poured over his porcelain chin and onto the white fur of his chest. </p>

<p>“Yummy,” he whispered. </p>

<p>And only in that moment did it register that I was looking at something absolutely terrifying. What was wrong with me? Fuck. My parasympathetic nervous system ignited, heart suddenly pounding, wrenching blood from my face. </p>

<p>“What’s wrong buddy?” it asked. Another spoonful of orange. “You miss Beth, don’t you?”</p>

<p>I managed a shuddering breath in response. </p>

<p>“Aww, cat got your lung?”</p>

<p>Nope. Fuck that. </p>

<p>I shifted tentatively, testing the waters. The cat-thing didn’t move. So I bolted, ran for the front door to my apartment, flung it open. </p>

<p>Stopped and nearly fell flat. </p>

<p>Dozens of long, protuberant limbs now rose from the elevator shaft, groping around the walls, floors, ceiling—everywhere—<em>me</em>. One of the hands grabbed my ankle and squeezed hard enough that my foot prickled. Another took my arm a second later. </p>

<p>“Charlie, I wouldn’t jump if I were you!” my voice called from behind me. “That thing’ll bend you in your straight parts.”</p>

<p>As soon as the cat said it, a hand found my knee and I felt a sharp strain on my shin bone. </p>

<p>“Help!” I screamed. </p>

<p>“Gimme a second buddy! Washing dishes! You wouldn’t believe how orange—“</p>

<p>“HELP ME!” </p>

<p>More hands had found me, grabbed me; the two on my leg flexed toward each other. I was screaming. Hearing my pain and terror as a surreal spectator of something horrific. </p>

<p>“NO! PLEASE! FU—<sup>crack</sup>—UCK!”</p>

<p>I saw bone pierce my shin, stretching the skin like cellophane and I screamed away my last breath of consciousness.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Charlie, Dora the Explorer band-aid or Sponge Bob?”</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I was cold. I wanted Beth. I needed her. But she wasn’t coming back. </p>

<p>…</p>

<p>“Charlie, I’m no doctor, but this legs is looking…”</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I felt wet fur against my skin and…<em>pain</em>. She wasn’t coming back—my fault. I let her love me and then I let her down. I let her drink instead of sharing myself with her. She had finished a bottle of Tanqueray alone the day she left, the day I said nothing to keep her from leaving. But if I had just spoken, been present, she wouldn’t have—<em>pain</em>—the officer who came to my door had said—<em>pain</em>—the way he chewed his lip—<em>pain</em>—I called him a liar—<em>pain…PAIN!</em></p>

<p>“Charlie, when I push the bone I can see it move under your skin. Yuck.”</p>

<p>I roused screaming, vomit joining the sound in my throat with a gurgle as the cat’s little doll face stared up at me from my legs. </p>

<p>“Oh, good, you’re awake,” it said lightly. “It’s been hours buddy. I’m soooo bored.”</p>

<p>I was on my bed, a small comfort. But then I glanced at my leg. A mistake. Angry, bloody, swollen, bruised to hell and covered in a patchwork of children&#39;s band-aids. Sickening. But I was alive. Alive and tended to by a psychotic cat monster that had stolen my voice. A monster covered in <em>my jelly</em>. </p>

<p>“W-what do you w-want?” I stammered, as my endorphins momentarily swallowed the sharpest pain and left me with ache and naked fear. </p>

<p>The cat chuckled. “I want you to be better, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“What are you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m—<em>you</em>.  The happiest you and the saddest you…and the most adorable you…obvi.”</p>

<p>No. The cat had my voice, but this was a trick. It wanted me to suffer. And maybe—maybe I deserved it. </p>

<p>“You ordered me, Charlie,” it continued. “You need me. Because I’m the better you. Or maybe you’re the better <em>me</em>. One of us surely. Hard to say… You got any pot?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Found a joint. You mind?”</p>

<p>“W-what?”</p>

<p>It lifted a thin cigarette to the pinhole between its pursed white lips. The joint swam in the loose glistening fur of its hand. But somehow the cat made it work. Next it produced a lighter—<em>shick-shick</em>—the sound made me wince but the flame caught quickly and the cat drew up a ragged ember. Smoke lolled out from its eye holes. I shivered.</p>

<p>“Charlie…do you wanna build a death ray?  With me, I mean.”</p>

<p>“What?”  Nothing about anything made sense. </p>

<p>“It’s not—don’t worry Charlie, it’s a <em>humanitarian</em> death ray. Kind of a last step…”</p>

<p>The cat stubbed out the joint in its fur. “Here, I’ll show you.”  </p>

<p>It went to my desk, grabbed my laptop, brought it to me. My screen saver said <strong>TI:ME.</strong>  Looking at it, I realized that I had no clue what time it was, or what day for that matter. My living doldrums had erased my need for normal concerns. I was a middle train car, pulled along by some distant engine and held firm to an unknown trajectory by the circumstantial tracks below me. Nothing mattered. </p>

<p>I entered my password and cringed at the sight of happy hues. The words on the screen were predictable, I supposed:</p>

<p><strong>HOW TO BUILD A HUMANITARIAN DEATH RAY</strong></p>

<p><strong>STEP 1: REMOVE TOAST.</strong></p>

<p>There was another imbedded video, something horrible probably, I didn’t care. </p>

<p><em>Click</em></p>

<p>A close shot of a polished marble countertop, a slice of bread, too much peanut butter, blood. A pretty, pale olive-skinned hand with chartreuse nail polish swept awkwardly across the frame. Peanut butter clung to the clotted gash in the index finger. I watched, dread simmering in my gut.</p>

<p>“Why’d you buy those? Runts are like the worst kind of candy.”</p>

<p>My voice played through the speakers. From a conversation years passed. How…</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I like the bananas. Is that weird?” Beth’s voice.</p>

<p>“I mean…”</p>

<p>“You know what, I like ‘em. They’re like you, kinda.”</p>

<p>“What? Gross?”</p>

<p>“<em>Sweet</em>, dork. And nothing like you’d expect by looking at them, because they’re good. And yeah, a little gross.”</p>

<p>I heard my laugh. Her laugh. And as the camera began to pan backwards, my stomach turned. The pretty smiling racial-everywoman from the first HeartHappi video I’d seen was now mottled, head hanging limply, half-concealed by a blood-matted cascade of hair. Dead. But held aloft by strings like some nightmarish marionette. The word:</p>

<p><strong>REMOVED!</strong></p>

<p>flashed across the screen. </p>

<p>The marionette girl hadn’t done anything. Nothing had changed, but the strings jerked and her hands sparred in the air in what looked like a mimicry of applause. Then the camera panned down toward the ground, past cables and gaffers tape, a soda can, a pair of shoes, and it settled on a chrome toaster sitting on the floor. </p>

<p><strong>HappiFact: A standard consumer two-slice toaster has all the necessary components for constructing a functional death ray!</strong></p>

<p><strong>HeartHAPPI</strong>™<br/>
<strong><em>Find a better you.</em></strong></p>

<p>The video ended. I needed to make a death ray. Immediately. I turned to the cat. </p>

<p>“How do I do it?”</p>

<p>The cat sighed long. “It’s easy. One more video. No blood. No strings.” He gestured to my computer screen. </p>

<p><strong>STEP 2: Ctrl+A Ctrl+C Ctrl+X Ctrl+V</strong></p>

<p>What? “I—I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“It’s a stupid game, Charlie, but it’s your stupid game.  It’s one of the parts of you that she loved.”</p>

<p>I stared at the screen. What was I supposed to copy? I tried to find reason in the mystery, but my fingers acted on their own. Routine opened notepad. </p>

<p><em>Ctrl+A</em></p>

<p>Nothing. </p>

<p><em>Ctrl+C</em></p>

<p>Nothing. </p>

<p><em>Ctrl+X</em></p>

<p>…Nothing. No fear, no pain, no doldrums, no guilt. Nothing. <em>Ctrl</em>... My index finger hovered over the <em>V</em> key. </p>

<p><em>Click</em></p>

<p>Notepad crashed. My browser was waiting behind it. The HeartHappi website was playing a video—my bathroom, me. Me filling the tub, testing the water, me walking down the hall, toasting bread, making a peanut butter sandwich. </p>

<p>Beth had always been particular about jelly, she went to special stores and bought special brands. I bought JiF peanut butter, ordinary, but chunky at least, I’m not a fucking monster. …She would’ve liked that joke. She would’ve laughed harder than it deserved, but she was good like that. She was the special to compliment my ordinary. And when she died, I didn’t think I deserved special anymore. I didn’t buy jelly, I bought peanut butter and settled for ordinary. </p>

<p>In the video, I sat down at my little kitchen table and ate alone. I didn’t bother with a plate. When I was done eating, I stared for a long while, I was crying, fists clenched and then punching the brick wall that ran alongside the table. The video had no sound, but I could see the scream on my face. Pain. Then I stood, walked to the counter, unplugged the toaster from the wall. </p>

<p><em>A standard consumer two-slice toaster has all the necessary components for constructing a functional death ray...</em></p>

<p>I watched me walk down the hall, back to the bathroom; I plugged in the toaster, pulled the lever, got in the tub and…let the toaster fall. I tried to tune out my mental buzz filling in the silent convulsions of an impossible me. </p>

<p>That me sunk into the water, still. </p>

<p><strong>HeartHAPPI</strong>™<br/>
<strong><em>Stop copying yourself.</em></strong></p>

<p>The string of little green lights on my router had guttered out.  A light flickered in the hall. My A/C unit had fallen silent. </p>

<p>“What the fuck did I just watch, cat?” I asked. </p>

<p>No answer. </p>

<p>I turned and saw a heap of wet gray fur and a little porcelain doll face piled on the floor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took me a while to get it, but I did eventually. He—the cat—<em>was</em> me; a variation, a <em>copy</em>. The me that resigned himself to eating peanut butter sandwiches because buying jelly felt too much like admitting that she’d never buy it again. He was the me that drew a bath and didn’t come back to the computer. The me that took the pain. Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V—cut, paste. </p>

<p>I was the me that lived, a me with memories and scabbed knuckles and broken bones…but I was alive. And I wasn’t better, not really. But in spite of all the terror and the dread and the pain, I was better than I was when the story began. And that’s not nothing. It might even be good enough. </p>
